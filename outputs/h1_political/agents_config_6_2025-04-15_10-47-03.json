Please have a conversation by chatting with them about inmigration policies.\n    Specifically, we are interested in you sharing what you think makes life meaningful and learning your conversation partner's thoughts as someone that might hold different values and beliefs.\n    For example, survey research shows that some people believe that stronger enforcement of our immigration laws is more important than creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens, while others believe the opposite. \n    Survey research also shows that some people believe that undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes, while others believe they are not.\n    Please share your views on immigration policy with each other.\n    Limit your words to 50.\n    Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: I believe in humane immigration reform that balances border security with pathways to citizenship. We should prioritize those who contribute to our society and economy, while ensuring fair treatment and due process for all.", "Agent1: I believe strong border enforcement is crucial for national security and economic stability.

Secure the border first, then address other issues.", "Agent0: Comprehensive immigration reform is vital. We need secure borders, but also a pathway to citizenship for those contributing to our society. Family reunification is also key.", "Agent1: Secure borders are paramount. We must enforce existing laws and prioritize deporting criminals. A merit-based system that favors skilled workers benefits our economy more than open borders."]}
