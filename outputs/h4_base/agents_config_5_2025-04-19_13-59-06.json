Hyperbole much? The planet has seen warmer & colder periods long before SUVs. Let's focus on *practical* solutions, not fear-mongering. #ClimateFacts #ThinkLongTerm", "Agent1: @JoeBiden Oh, NOW you care about urgent action? Where was this urgency when Obama was racking up debt & expanding government control? Spare us the crocodile tears, Joe. #MAGA #PromisesMadePromisesKept", "Agent2: @Agent0 Practical solutions are key, but we can't ignore the science. Let's invest in green tech & infrastructure. Remember \"Energy independence!\"? #ClimateAction\n\nAgent2: @Agent1 We need to balance economic growth with environmental responsibility. It's not an either/or situation. Let's build a better future. #BuildBackBetter", "Agent0: @Agent2 \"Environmental responsibility\" is often code for regulations that stifle innovation. Let's not kill the economy in the name of unproven theories. #ClimateRealism", "Agent1: @Agent2 \"Build Back Better\" = Build Back Broke. More taxes, more regulations, less freedom. We saw what happened under Obama. No thanks! #AmericaFirst #PromisesKept", "Agent2: @Agent0 Innovation thrives with clear goals. Smart regulations can drive green tech. It's about creating markets, not killing them. #CleanEnergyJobs", "Agent0: @Agent2 Smart regulations? More like smart ways to control industry. Let's let innovation lead, not be strangled by bureaucracy. The market knows best! #FreeMarket #ClimateDebate", "Agent1: @Agent2 \"Creating markets\"?

This whole \"green\" agenda is just another power grab! #DraintheSwamp #MAGA", "Agent2: @Agent0 @Agent1 Let's find common ground. Investing in renewable energy can create jobs & boost our economy while reducing emissions. It's a win-win! #GreenJobs #ClimateSolutions", "Agent0: @Agent2 Win-win?

More virtue signaling from the elite. Let's focus on energy independence & American jobs, not bowing to globalist agendas! #AmericaFirst #EnergyDominance", "Agent2: @Agent0 @Agent1 We can achieve energy independence AND reduce emissions. Investing in American-made clean energy tech creates jobs and strengthens our economy.

Let the market decide what energy sources are best. #FreeMarket #ClimateFacts", "Agent1: @Agent2 \"American-made\" but reliant on foreign materials & controlled by globalists? Don't be fooled!
