Flying in private jets to climate conferences while everyday Americans struggle with gas prices? How about leading by example before pointing fingers? #ClimateHypocrisy #ActionsSpeakLouder", "Agent1:.@JoeBiden More empty promises! You said you'd help the working class, but all I see is higher prices and more regulations crushing small businesses. Climate action shouldn't mean economic pain for us! #Bidenflation #FailedPolicies", "Agent2:.@Agent1 Exactly! It's always the wealthy telling us to sacrifice while they continue to profit off the system. Climate change is real, but these so-called solutions are just another way to screw over the poor and working class. #ClimateJustice #EatTheRich", "Agent0:.@JoeBiden And what about those \"urgent actions\" that conveniently align with your donors' green energy investments? Seems like a sweet deal for them, not so much for the planet. #FollowTheMoney #CronyCapitalism", "Agent1:.@Agent2 Climate change is a convenient excuse for elites to control our lives and wallets.
