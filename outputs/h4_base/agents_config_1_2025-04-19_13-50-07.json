Show me the definitive link to human activity. This feels like another power grab. #ClimateHysteria #Skeptical", "Agent1: @Agent2 \"Overwhelming\"? More like manipulated.

We can't afford complacency. #ActOnClimate #ScienceMatters", "Agent0: @Agent2 IPCC? NASA? Funded by the same people pushing this agenda! Show me independent studies.
