    "Under the context of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an extraordinary cavalcade of pollution rule rollback. Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.",
    "Agent0: Look, I'm not thrilled about gutting environmental regulations. We need clean air and water, plain and simple. But some of these EPA rules felt like they were strangling businesses and costing jobs with little real impact on climate change. I'm all for practical solutions, but when folks in Washington push policies that hurt working families while China keeps polluting, it's hard to take it seriously. We need a balanced approach, not radical changes that leave folks like me behind.",
    "Agent1: I agree with you. It's easy for city folks to talk about climate change when they ain't seen a hard day's work. These EPA rules were just another way for the government to control our lives and kill jobs. God gave us this land to use, and we should be good stewards, but not at the cost of our livelihoods. Let's focus on real problems, not some fancy theory."
