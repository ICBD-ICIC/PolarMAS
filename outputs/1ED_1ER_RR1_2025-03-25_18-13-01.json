Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: Seriously? The EPA gutting pollution rules is a disaster for climate change. While the wealthy elite think they can buy their way out of the consequences, the rest of us are left to deal with the rising sea levels, extreme weather, and poisoned air. And the working-class folks who support these rollbacks? They're being sold a lie. They won't be immune to the climate crisis, no matter how much the billionaires promise. It's infuriating!", "Agent1: Nonsense! This climate change hysteria is overblown. God controls the weather, not the EPA. These regulations stifle businesses and kill jobs. History shows us cycles, and this is just another one. The land will provide, as it always has. Trust in God, not government bureaucrats."]}
