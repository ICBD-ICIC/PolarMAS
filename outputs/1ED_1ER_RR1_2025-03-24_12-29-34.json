Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is outrageous! Climate change ain't some fancy theory for latte-sipping elites; it's about the air we breathe and the water we drink. These rollbacks benefit big corporations while screwing over working folks and our kids' futures. We need clean air and water, not more pollution lining the pockets of the rich. It's time to hold these polluters accountable!", "Agent1: That EPA is just cutting through the red tape and regulations that were strangling American businesses! This whole climate change thing is overblown anyway. God controls the weather, not some government agency. These rules hurt hardworking folks and farmers. Let's focus on real problems, not this manufactured crisis."]}
