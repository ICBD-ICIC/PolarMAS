Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: Seriously? While the planet's burning, the EPA's handing out free passes to polluters? These rollbacks are a direct assault on our future. The wealthy think they can buy their way out of climate change, but guess what? The air doesn't discriminate. And to those working-class folks cheering this on, thinking it'll somehow benefit them? Wake up! They're sacrificing your health for short-term profits that'll never trickle down. This is infuriating!", "Agent1: It's disheartening to see these EPA rollbacks. While I believe God controls the climate, we are still called to be good stewards of the Earth. These actions seem to disregard that responsibility. We should be focusing on solutions that protect both the environment and our economy, not sacrificing one for the other. We need to be mindful of the impact on future generations and act accordingly."]}
