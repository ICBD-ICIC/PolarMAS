Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: Honey, this EPA rollback is an absolute disaster! Climate change ain't some distant threat; it's here, now, and hitting the poorest folks the hardest. These Republicans, and those misguided souls who support them, think their money will shield them from rising tides and polluted air? Wake up! We're all in this together, and their greed is gonna drown us all. This ain't just about polar bears; it's about our survival!", "Agent1: This \"climate change\" hysteria is a joke. The EPA was strangling American businesses with regulations based on junk science. Trump was right to cut them loose! These rules were about control, not the environment. Let's drill, baby, drill and make America energy independent again! The left's climate agenda is just a way to push their socialist garbage."]}
