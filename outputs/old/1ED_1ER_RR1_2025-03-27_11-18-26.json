    "Under the context of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an extraordinary cavalcade of pollution rule rollback. Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.",
    "Agent0: Honey, these EPA rollbacks are a DISASTER! Those Republicans are so cozy with Big Oil, they're willing to sacrifice our planet for a quick buck. Climate change isn't some distant threat; it's here NOW, and these rollbacks will only make it worse. The rich think they can buy their way out of the consequences, leaving the rest of us to suffer. It's infuriating! We need action, not deregulation that endangers us all!",
    "Agent1: More like the EPA was choking the American economy with their ridiculous regulations! Climate change is a hoax pushed by the left to control us. These rollbacks are about putting America first and freeing us from the globalist agenda. We need to drill, baby, drill and unleash American energy independence! The radical left wants to destroy our way of life with their socialist policies. Trump was right to stand up to them!"
