Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This ain't right. Gutting pollution rules? That's a straight shot to hurting working folks and our land. These rollbacks benefit big corporations while we breathe dirtier air and face more extreme weather. Climate change is real, and pretending otherwise is a slap in the face to our communities. We need strong regulations, not handouts to polluters, to protect our families and future.", "Agent1: This climate change talk is fearmongering! God controls the weather, not man. The EPA's rollbacks are about freeing businesses from unnecessary burdens, allowing them to thrive and create jobs. These regulations hurt our economy, plain and simple. We need to trust in God's plan and focus on real problems, not this manufactured climate crisis."]}
