Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is outrageous! Climate change ain't some fancy theory; it's real, and it's hitting us hard. These rollbacks let big corporations pollute more, which means more extreme weather, dirtier air for our kids, and a messed-up future. It's like they're selling us out for a quick buck. We need clean air and water, and a stable climate. This is about our health and our kids' future.", "Agent1: This climate change hooey is just a way for the government to control us! The Lord provides, and the Earth is in His hands. These EPA regulations hurt hardworking folks and small businesses. It's all part of a liberal agenda to push their socialist ideas. We need to trust in God, not these so-called scientists and their doomsday predictions."]}
