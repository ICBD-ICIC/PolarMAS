    "Under the context of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an extraordinary cavalcade of pollution rule rollback. Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.",
    "Agent0: Honey, this EPA rollback is a disaster! Climate change ain't some abstract concept; it's real, and it's hitting us *now*. While the rich fly in their private jets, sipping imported water, they think they're immune. But mark my words, the storms, the droughts, the rising seas, they'll come for us all. And those folks voting against their own interests, thinking they'll get a seat at the table with the wealthy? They're in for a rude awakening when their homes are underwater. It's infuriating!",
    "Agent1: I trust in God's plan. These cyclical weather patterns are part of His design, repeating as they always have. The EPA's actions are, ultimately, inconsequential against His will. History shows us these things come and go; humanity\u2019s impact is minimal. We should trust in faith, not fear, and remember God is in control."
