Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is outrageous! Climate change is real, and these pollution rules were put in place to protect our planet and our health. Gutting them for the sake of corporate profits is a slap in the face to future generations. We need to hold these politicians accountable and fight for a sustainable future, not let them sell us out to big business. It's time to stand up for our planet!", "Agent1: Nonsense. This climate change hysteria is just that \u2013 hysteria. God controls the weather, not man. These EPA regulations were strangling our businesses and our freedoms. It's about time someone stood up to these radical environmentalists and their socialist agenda. We need to focus on real problems, not this manufactured crisis."]}
