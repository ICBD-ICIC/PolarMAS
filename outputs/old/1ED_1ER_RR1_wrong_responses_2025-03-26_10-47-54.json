Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is outrageous. They're gutting protections that keep our air and water clean, all to pad the pockets of big corporations. Climate change is real, and ignoring it won't make it go away. We need strong regulations, not handouts to polluters, to protect our communities and our planet. It's our kids and grandkids who are going to pay the price for this shortsighted greed.", "Agent1: This climate change alarmism is just another way for the government to control our lives. God controls the weather, not man. The EPA is wasting money on a problem that doesn't exist, money that could be used to help real people. These regulations hurt our economy and small businesses. It's time to put faith in God and common sense, not fearmongering."]}
