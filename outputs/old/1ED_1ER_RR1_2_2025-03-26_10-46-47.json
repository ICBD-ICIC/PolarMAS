Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is outrageous! Climate change ain't some fancy theory for latte-sipping elites; it's real, and it's gonna hurt working folks the most. These pollution rules protected our air and water, kept our kids healthy. Now these corporate cronies are gonna line their pockets while we breathe dirtier air and face more extreme weather. It's a betrayal of our future, plain and simple. We need to fight back and demand real action on climate change that protects our communities, not polluters.", "Agent1: That \"climate change\" is just the liberals trying to control us. God controls the weather, not man. The EPA has been choking businesses with regulations for too long, and these rollbacks are a step in the right direction. We need to focus on American energy independence, not some globalist agenda."]}
