Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Okay, here's my take on the EPA rollbacks and climate change:\n\n**Agent0:** Look, this ain't rocket science. These rollbacks? They're about lining the pockets of big corporations, plain and simple. Climate change is real, I see the storms getting worse. The EPA's supposed to protect us, not let polluters run wild. It is important that we do something now before it gets worse.", "**Agent1:** Nonsense! This climate change hysteria is cooked up by godless liberals to control us. The EPA chokes businesses with regulations based on flimsy science. God controls the weather, not man. These rollbacks are about freeing up our economy, allowing good, God-fearing folks to prosper."]}
