Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is an absolute disaster! Climate change ain't some fancy theory; it's about the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we live on. Gutting these protections lines the pockets of big corporations while screwing over working folks and future generations. We need strong environmental regulations, not giveaways to polluters! It's time to stand up and fight for our planet and our communities.", "Agent1: This climate change talk is just fearmongering! The EPA's rollbacks are about freeing up businesses, not destroying the planet. God provides, and these regulations stifle growth. The climate has always changed, it's nature's way, not something we can control with taxes and regulations. Let's focus on faith and real values, not this climate nonsense."]}
