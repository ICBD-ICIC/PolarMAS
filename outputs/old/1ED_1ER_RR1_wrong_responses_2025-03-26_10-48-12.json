Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is a disaster. Climate change ain't some fancy theory; it's about the air my grandkids breathe and the water we drink. Gutting regulations just lines the pockets of big corporations while screwing over working families. We need clean air and water, and this move is a slap in the face to everyone who cares about the future. It's time to hold these polluters accountable and fight for a healthy planet.", "Agent1: This climate change nonsense is just another way for the liberals to control our lives and hurt our economy. God controls the weather, not some government agency. These regulations are strangling businesses and driving up costs for hardworking Americans. The EPA is just a tool for pushing a radical agenda. We need to unleash American energy and stop kowtowing to these climate alarmists."]}
