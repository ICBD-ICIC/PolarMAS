Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is a disaster. Gutting pollution rules while climate change accelerates? It's infuriating! The wealthy elite think they're immune, but environmental devastation doesn't discriminate. And those working-class folks supporting this? They're being sold a lie. They think they'll be protected, but they'll be the first to suffer from poisoned air and water. It's short-sighted, greedy, and frankly, evil. We need action, not deregulation, to protect our planet and our future.", "Agent1: This is outrageous! The EPA is selling out America to radical environmentalists. Climate change is a hoax perpetrated by globalists to destroy our economy. Trump tried to stop this madness, but the Democrats are pushing their socialist agenda, endangering our jobs and way of life. We need to stand strong against this tyranny and protect American freedom!"]}
