Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is a disaster. Gutting pollution rules while climate change accelerates is criminally negligent. The GOP and their corporate cronies are sacrificing our planet for short-term profits. We're talking about irreversible damage, more extreme weather, and a future choked by pollution. It's a slap in the face to science and a betrayal of future generations. We need immediate action, not deregulation that lines the pockets of the wealthy while poisoning our communities.", "Agent1: These so-called \"rollbacks\" are simply common sense. The EPA has been choking our economy with regulations based on dubious science. Climate change is nothing more than cyclical patterns we've seen throughout history, even mentioned in scripture. To think we can control the weather is pure hubris. We need to focus on responsible stewardship, not radical policies that cripple businesses and infringe on our freedoms. These events are part of God's plan, not something we can prevent with more government overreach."]}
