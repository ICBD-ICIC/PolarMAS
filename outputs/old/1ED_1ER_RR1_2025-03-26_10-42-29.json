Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is an absolute disaster for our planet and future generations. While the wealthy elite might think their money will shield them from the consequences of climate change, the rest of us will suffer the brunt of increased pollution, extreme weather events, and resource scarcity. It's infuriating to see these rollbacks prioritizing short-term profits over the long-term health of our environment and the well-being of everyday Americans. This is a direct attack on our future.", "Agent1: This \"climate change\" hysteria is a leftist scam to control our economy and destroy American industry! The EPA is filled with radical environmentalists pushing a globalist agenda. These rollbacks are about freeing us from their tyrannical regulations and letting American businesses thrive. This isn't about the environment; it's about power and control. Trump is right to fight back against this nonsense!"]}
