Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is outrageous! Climate change ain't some fancy theory for academics to debate \u2013 it's about the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we live on. These rollbacks benefit big corporations at the expense of our health and future. We're talking about more extreme weather, dirtier air, and irreversible damage. It's a slap in the face to working families who are already struggling. We need action, not deregulation, to protect our planet and our communities.", "Agent1: This climate change alarmism is ridiculous. The EPA's rollbacks are about cutting unnecessary red tape that's strangling our economy. God gave us this land to use, and we shouldn't let fearmongering about the weather dictate how we live. These regulations hurt hardworking Americans and small businesses. The climate has always changed, and it always will. It's arrogant to think we can control it. Let's focus on real problems, not manufactured crises."]}
