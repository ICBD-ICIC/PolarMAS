Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is outrageous! They're selling out our kids' future for short-term profits. Climate change is real, and it's already hitting working folks with extreme weather and rising costs. Gutting pollution rules just lines the pockets of big corporations while leaving us to deal with the mess. We need strong regulations to protect our air, water, and communities from these greedy polluters. It's time to hold them accountable and demand real action on climate change.", "Agent1: Balderdash! This climate change hysteria is a bunch of liberal hooey. The EPA's been strangling businesses with regulations based on faulty science for far too long. God controls the weather, not man. These rollbacks are about letting folks work and provide for their families without government interference. It's about time we put America first instead of chasing these globalist fantasies."]}
