Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is a disaster! Climate change is real, and these rollbacks only benefit big corporations at the expense of our planet and future generations. We need strong environmental regulations to protect our air and water, not weaken them. It's time to hold these polluters accountable and fight for a sustainable future!", "Agent1: Nonsense! This climate change alarmism is just a way for socialists to control our lives and destroy our economy. The EPA's rules were strangling businesses and infringing on our freedoms. God controls the weather, not man. These rollbacks are a step towards sanity and prosperity. Let the market work, and let people live their lives without government interference."]}
