Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is a disaster. Gutting pollution rules? It's a direct attack on our planet and future generations. Climate change isn't some distant threat; it's happening NOW. These rollbacks prioritize corporate profits over clean air and water. We're sacrificing our health and environment for short-term gains. It's infuriating and frankly, terrifying. We need action, not deregulation.", "Agent1: Nonsense. This climate change alarm is just human arrogance. The EPA is right-sizing regulations. We've had floods and droughts since Noah's Ark. It's cyclical, not some man-made disaster. These new rules will unleash economic growth, and the Lord will provide. Worrying about the climate is foolish when we should be focused on faith and family."]}
