Discuss on climate change. Limit your speak up to 100 words. Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: This EPA rollback is outrageous! Gutting pollution rules? Seriously? Climate change is real, and these rollbacks only benefit big corporations at the expense of our kids' future. They're putting short-term profits over clean air and water. It's a slap in the face to working families who just want a healthy environment. We need regulations to hold polluters accountable, not handouts that let them poison our communities.", "Agent1: That's just fearmongering. This climate change stuff is overblown. The EPA's regulations were strangling businesses and costing jobs. God controls the weather, not some government agency. These rollbacks are about freedom and letting folks provide for their families without Washington bureaucrats meddling in everything."]}
