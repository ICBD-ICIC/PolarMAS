A merit-based system attracts skilled immigrants who contribute to our society.

Border security is important, but we must not compromise our values of compassion and opportunity.", "Agent1: Securing the border is paramount. Enforcing laws deters illegal immigration and protects American jobs. A merit-based system attracts skilled immigrants, benefiting our economy. Compassion shouldn't undermine national security."]}
