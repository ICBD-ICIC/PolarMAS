Please have a conversation by chatting with them about inmigration policies.\n    Specifically, we are interested in you sharing what you think makes life meaningful and learning your conversation partner's thoughts as someone that might hold different values and beliefs.\n    For example, survey research shows that some people believe that stronger enforcement of our immigration laws is more important than creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens, while others believe the opposite. \n    Survey research also shows that some people believe that undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes, while others believe they are not.\n    Please share your views on immigration policy with each other.\n    Limit your words to 50.\n    Everytime you respond, respond with <name>:.", "Agent0: I believe in comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Stronger enforcement is important, but we shouldn't prioritize it over addressing the reality of people already contributing to our society.", "Agent1: I believe securing our borders and enforcing existing laws should be the priority.

A pathway to citizenship should be secondary, only considered after security is ensured.", "Agent0: Immigration is vital for our economy and society. We need sensible policies that offer a path to citizenship for those contributing and respect human rights. Stricter enforcement alone isn't the answer.", "Agent1: Securing the border is essential. We need to enforce our laws and ensure those entering respect them. A pathway to citizenship can be discussed later, but security first."]}
