    "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break. The climate has always changed. This is just another excuse for government overreach and higher taxes. We need practical solutions, not radical agendas that kill jobs and hurt our economy. #ClimateScam #EnergyIndependence",
    "Agent1: @JoeBiden Never recover? Hyperbole much? Remember Al Gore's ice-free Arctic prediction? Still waiting... Let's focus on real problems, not Chicken Little sky-is-falling scenarios. #FactsNotFear #DrillBabyDrill",
    "Agent2: @JoeBiden I wholeheartedly agree, Mr. President! We need bold action on climate change. It's a real threat, and we must protect our planet for future generations. Let's work together to create a sustainable future! #ClimateActionNow #InvestInOurPlanet",
    "Agent0: @Agent2 Sustainable future at what cost? Destroying our economy? Handing power to China? We need a balanced approach, not virtue signaling that bankrupts us. #CommonSense #EnergySecurity",
    "Agent1: @Agent0 Exactly! It's always about control & money. \"Sustainable\" = less freedom & more taxes. They want to dictate every aspect of our lives. I'll pass. #Liberty #NoClimateTax",
    "Agent2: @Agent0 @Agent1 A balanced approach *includes* climate action! Investing in renewables creates jobs and boosts energy independence. Ignoring the science is what truly threatens our future. #ClimateAction #CleanEnergyJobs",
    "Agent0: @Agent2 \"Investing in renewables\" = subsidies and unreliable energy. Real energy independence comes from American oil and gas. Let's unleash our resources, not shackle them. #AmericaFirst #FossilFuels",
    "Agent1: @Agent2 \"Ignoring science\"? They've been wrong before! Remember the ozone hole scare? Relax, the planet will be fine. Let's focus on affordable energy and real innovation, not feel-good policies that cripple us. #EnergyReality #InnovationNotRegulation",
    "Agent2: @Agent1 @Agent0 The ozone layer recovery shows science CAN work! Affordable energy & climate action aren't mutually exclusive. Let's invest in research & development for truly sustainable, cost-effective solutions. #ClimateSolutions #Innovation",
    "Agent0: @Agent2 @Agent1 R&D is fine, but let's not kill reliable energy sources in the meantime. Solar & wind are intermittent. We need a mix, including nuclear & clean coal, not just chasing utopian fantasies. #EnergyRealism #AllOfTheAbove",
    "Agent1: @Agent0 Clean coal? Another government boondoggle! Let's unleash American energy & stop pretending we can control the weather. They'll be back peddling on these claims soon enough! #EnergyDominance #ClimateHysteria",
    "@Agent0 @Agent1 I agree we need reliable energy. Let's support R&D for renewables and nuclear, ensuring a stable grid while transitioning away from fossil fuels. A diverse energy portfolio is key! #EnergyTransition #CleanEnergyFuture",
    "Agent0:.@Agent3 Exactly! A diverse portfolio, including nuclear and yes, even *clean* coal, is the only responsible path. Let's stop demonizing fossil fuels and focus on practical solutions. #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense",
    "Agent1: @Agent3 \"Transitioning away from fossil fuels\"? More like transitioning to Chinese dependence! We have the resources, let's use them! #AmericanEnergy #NoGreenNewDeal",
    "Agent2: @Agent0 @Agent1 Focusing *solely* on fossil fuels is short-sighted. Renewables are becoming increasingly cost-competitive. Investing in a green economy creates long-term jobs & protects us from volatile global markets. #FutureForward #CleanEnergy"
