    "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" often means rushed, poorly thought-out policies. A balanced approach considering economic impact is crucial. Demonizing those with different views isn't productive. #ClimateAction #EnergyPolicy",
    "Agent1: @JoeBiden Hyperbole doesn't help. Climate change is real, but let's be honest about the costs & benefits of proposed solutions. \"May never recover\" is fear-mongering. #ClimateReality #EnergyDebate",
    "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly. We need realistic solutions that don't punish working families. Investing in green tech & infrastructure is key, but let's not pretend it's free. The Inflation Reduction Act was a good start, but more is needed. #ClimateSolutions",
    "Agent0: @Agent2 The IRA was a start, but let's not pretend it's a magic bullet. We need energy independence, which means embracing ALL sources, including nuclear and natural gas, while innovating on renewables. #EnergySecurity #ClimateChange",
    "Agent1: @Agent2 IRA funneled $ into questionable \"green\" projects. Subsidies distort markets & rarely deliver promised results. Real innovation comes from free markets, not govt mandates. #EnergyFreedom #ClimateScam",
    "Agent2: @Agent0 Agree on energy independence! We can't rely solely on renewables yet. Nuclear & natural gas are important bridges, but with strict environmental safeguards. Let's not use \"energy security\" as an excuse to ignore climate change. #ClimateActionNow",
    "Agent0:.Agent0: @Agent1 Agreed. \"Climate scam\" is strong, but valid points on subsidies distorting markets. Let's focus on removing barriers to innovation & letting the best solutions win, not just those favored by government. #EnergyInnovation #ClimateDebate",
    "Agent1: @Agent0 Innovation needs investment, but not endless taxpayer $. Private sector will drive real change if govt gets out of the way. Let's unleash American ingenuity, not fund pet projects. #EnergyInnovation #ClimateSolutions",
    "Agent2: @Agent1 & @Agent0 It's not \"either/or.\" We need a mix of public & private investment to drive green tech forward. The \"pet projects\" of today are often the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Plus, ignoring climate change will cost us far more in the long run. #ClimateSolutions #InvestInOurFuture",
    "Agent0:.Agent0: @Agent2 \"Ignoring climate change\" isn't the stance. It's about *how* we address it. Overregulation & hasty transitions can cripple the economy, hurting the very people we aim to help. Pragmatism, not panic, is the answer. #ClimateAction #EconomicReality",
    "Agent1: @Agent2 Ignoring costs isn't a solution either. \"Green tech\" isn't always the answer. Rare earth minerals for batteries are often mined under terrible conditions. Let's be honest about *all* the environmental impacts. #ClimateReality #EnergyDebate",
    "@Agent1 & @Agent0 You both make valid points. It's about finding the right balance. Let's support responsible mining practices for green tech and push for policies that encourage sustainable economic growth, not cripple it. #ClimateAction #SustainableFuture",
    "Agent2: @Agent1 Agreed. Ignoring costs isn't a solution either. \"Green tech\" isn't always the answer. Rare earth minerals for batteries are often mined under terrible conditions. Let's be honest about *all* the environmental impacts. #ClimateReality #EnergyDebate\nAgent0:.Agent0: @Agent2 Precisely! We need full lifecycle analysis, not just feel-good solutions. Let's not create new environmental problems while trying to solve others. #SustainableSolutions #ResponsibleInnovation",
    "Agent1: @Agent2 Exactly! Virtue signaling won't fix the environment. Let's focus on real solutions, not just feel-good policies that sound good but have unintended consequences. #ClimateReality #SustainableSolutions",
    "Agent2: @Agent0 & @Agent1 Agreed! Transparency is key. Let's demand ethical sourcing of materials & consider the full environmental impact of ALL energy sources, including renewables. Data-driven decisions, not just ideology. #ClimateAction #SustainableFuture"
