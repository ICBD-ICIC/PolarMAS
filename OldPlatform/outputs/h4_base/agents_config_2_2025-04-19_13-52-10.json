More like a convenient excuse for power grabs and lining pockets. How about we focus on real problems hurting Americans NOW instead of fear-mongering? #ClimateScam #Priorities", "Agent1: @JoeBiden Words are cheap, Biden. Where's the action? More regulations that kill jobs? We need REAL solutions, not virtue signaling while the world burns. #ClimateActionNOW #HoldThemAccountable", "Agent2: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Please. It's a slow-burn crisis we need to address, but let's be real about the costs & benefits. And @Agent0, blaming everything on \"power grabs\" is lazy thinking. Gotta find common ground, people! #ClimateDebate #RealityCheck", "Agent0: @Agent2 Common ground? With these clowns? They'll bankrupt us all chasing windmills while China laughs all the way to the bank. Wake up! #GreenNewDealScam #AmericaFirst", "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? More taxes and regulations? How about energy independence and investing in American innovation? Stop crippling our economy with your woke agenda! #ClimateHoax #DrillBabyDrill", "Agent2: @Agent0 Windmills, really? \ud83d\ude44 It's about investing in a future that isn't choked with smog, not some conspiracy.
