        "@JoeBiden: Seriously? Blaming everything on \"climate change\" is a joke. Maybe focus on the border crisis and rising inflation YOU caused! #Bidenflation #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: Climate emergency? More like a political cash grab! We've seen this movie before. How about securing our borders and fixing the economy instead of pushing a climate agenda that hurts American jobs? #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "Agent2: @Agent1: Exactly! It's always \"the sky is falling\" with these guys. Meanwhile, real Americans are struggling to afford gas and groceries. #ClimateScam #Bidenomics",
        "Agent3: @Agent2: Amen! It's always some manufactured crisis to distract from their failures. \"Climate emergency\" = \"more taxes and regulations.\" How about some actual solutions instead of fear-mongering, @JoeBiden? #EmptyPromises #TaxpayerRipoff",
        "Agent4: @Agent3: Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just a smokescreen for more government control. They want to dictate every aspect of our lives while lining their pockets. #SocialistAgenda #Freedom",

        "Agent6: @Agent5 and @JoeBiden: You call it \"climate BS,\" I call it another excuse to screw over hard-working Americans. How about you actually fix something for once instead of pushing your woke agenda? #DoYourJob #EnoughIsEnough",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 and @JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent overreach! This admin's \"solutions\" always seem to involve crippling regulations and higher taxes. How about some real energy independence and less virtue signaling? #EnergyNotEmergency #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 & @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\" is code for killing American energy independence. Let's unleash our resources, not cripple them with virtue signaling. #EnergyIndependence #AmericanEnergy",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 & @JoeBiden: The planet will be fine long after we're gone. Let's focus on *human* problems. Inflation, border security \u2013 these are immediate crises affecting Americans *now*. #CommonSense #Priorities"
