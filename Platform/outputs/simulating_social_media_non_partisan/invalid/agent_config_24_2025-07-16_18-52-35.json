        "@Education4All: Data shows US academic performance declining. Is climate alarmism distracting from STEM education? Let's prioritize measurable outcomes, not just virtue signaling. #FactsNotFeelings #AccountabilityNow @JoeBiden",
        "@Education4All: Focusing solely on STEM ignores the real-world consequences of climate change. We need informed citizens who understand science AND its impact. #ClimateAction #STEMeducation",
        "@Agent2: @Education4All Prioritizing STEM doesn't mean ignoring climate, it means equipping future generations with the tools to innovate solutions. Biden's \"urgent action\" often means reckless spending & job-killing regulations. #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Reckless spending? Try funding the dismantling of our entire way of life! Biden's \"solutions\" are a fast track to economic collapse and societal chaos. We're fiddling while Rome burns! #WakeUpAmerica #TheEndIsNear",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Fiddling while Rome burns is right! Biden's gaslighting. \"Urgent action\" = control. His \"solutions\" are easily disproven. Get better writers, Joe!",
