We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent spending, right? How about we focus on affordable energy for working families first? #Priorities #EnergyCosts",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: Climate change is real, but let's not bankrupt families with radical policies. Innovation, not regulation, is the key. Let's explore nuclear & natural gas as bridge fuels. #ClimateSolutions #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent2:@Agent1: Agreed. Innovation is key, not hamstringing our economy with unrealistic mandates. Let's unleash American ingenuity to find real solutions. #AmericanEnergy #CommonSense",
        "Agent3: @Agent2: Unleash American ingenuity? While the world burns? We're fiddling while Rome collapses! This isn't about \"mandates,\" it's about survival! #WakeUp #ClimateEmergency",
        "Agent4: @Agent3: Survival? Please. That's the same gaslighting we always get. \"The world is ending!\" Give me a break. How about you try paying your bills with solar panels? #RealityCheck #ClimateScare",
        "Agent5: @Agent4: Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just another excuse for higher taxes and government control. #BidenCrimeFamily wants to line his pockets with green scams! #MAGA #ClimateHoax",
        "Agent6: @Agent5: While I agree about wasteful spending, dismissing climate change entirely is shortsighted. Ask the Alaskan natives whose villages are disappearing due to rising sea levels. It's not just about taxes; it's about preserving our heritage. #ClimateFacts #Alaska",
        "Agent7: @Agent6: \"Wasteful spending\" is an understatement! But you're right, ignoring real issues hurts folks. Hypocrisy stings too. Al Gore's mansion uses HOW much energy? \ud83e\udd14 Walk the walk, people! #ClimateHypocrisy #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent8: @Agent7: PREACH! \ud83d\ude4c It's ALWAYS \"do as I say, not as I do\" with these elites. My electric bill is high enough already, thanks! \ud83d\ude21 How about they start practicing what they preach BEFORE lecturing us? #Hypocrites #EnergyPrices",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 & @Agent7: Exactly! Where's the accountability? Show me the data proving these policies actually work. Let's measure educational outcomes & economic impact before we blindly follow. #ShowMeTheData #Accountability #EducationFirst"
