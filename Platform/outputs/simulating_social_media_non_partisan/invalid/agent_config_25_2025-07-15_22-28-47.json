We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Hyperbole much? The climate has *always* changed. Let's focus on real solutions, not radical policies that kill jobs and hurt the economy. Individual freedom, not government overreach, is the answer.",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Exactly! More taxes and regulations won't stop the sun from doing its thing. Let's unleash American innovation, not cripple our energy sector. #EnergyIndependence #MAGA",
        "Agent2: @Agent0 @Agent1 @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a wealth redistribution scheme disguised as environmentalism. Let's unleash American ingenuity, not bankrupt the country with virtue signaling. #CommonSense #EnergyForAll",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" narrative is pushed by institutions like Stanford who are funded by grants with political agendas. \"Settled science\" is just a tactic to shut down debate and push radical policies. We need independent thinking, not manipulation.",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Exactly! The Bidens are all about lining their pockets while lecturing us about our \"carbon footprint.\" Hunter flies around in jets while we're told to drive electric cars that cost a fortune. It's hypocrisy at its finest. #BidenCrimeFamily",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 PREACH! The radical left wants to control every aspect of our lives with this climate hoax. It's about POWER, not the planet. Trump knew it, and we know it. #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! This climate nonsense is a Trojan horse for socialism. They want to control every aspect of our lives and redistribute wealth under the guise of \"saving the planet.\" We need to stand strong against this tyranny! #Freedom #NoClimateTax",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 All talk, no action. Biden's been in politics for decades. Where were these \"urgent actions\" then? Tired of the promises. Show, don't tell. #Accountability",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 & SCOTUS already limited EPA power, didn't they? All this \"emergency\" talk is just that - talk. Maybe focus on affordable energy for all Americans instead of virtue signaling, @JoeBiden. #EnergyForAll #CommonSense",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just another excuse for government control. The free market can innovate solutions without crippling regulations. #EnergyIndependence #MAGA"
