We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "Me: @JoeBiden While I agree climate change is a serious threat, I worry about the economic impact of some proposed solutions on working families. We need a plan that protects both our planet AND our paychecks. Let's find common ground.",
        "Me: <Agent1> @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" often means rushed, poorly thought-out policies. Let's focus on innovation, not mandates that kill jobs. The planet's pretty resilient, folks. #ClimateDebate #EconomyFirst",
        "Me: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"Climate change denier\"? That's rich coming from someone who can't even remember what day it is. Biden's policies will crush the economy. #WakeUpAmerica #BidenFail",
        "Me: @JoeBiden Hyperbole doesn't help. Let's talk realistic solutions. How do we balance environmental goals with energy independence and affordable gas prices for working-class Americans? #ClimateSolutions",
        "Me: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Please. The climate's been changing for millennia. Let's not bankrupt the country chasing windmills. Focus on real problems, like inflation. #CommonSense #ClimateRealism",
        "Me: @JoeBiden While I agree we need solutions, China's aggressive expansion in renewable energy tech is a bigger threat. We risk falling behind economically if we don't prioritize innovation and compete. #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Me: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\" is a convenient excuse for government overreach. Where's the data proving irreversible damage? Show us the concrete evidence, not just scary stories. #ClimateScam #ThinkForYourself",
        "Me: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" = higher taxes, fewer jobs, and more control for the Swamp. Biden & Warren's radical climate agenda is a Trojan horse for socialism. #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp",
        "Me: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\" is code for destroying our economy. The focus should be on American energy independence, not appeasing the radical left. Drill, baby, drill! #AmericaFirst #EnergySecurity",
        "Me: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" always seems to mean YOU get more power. The \"climate emergency\" is just a power grab. We need to focus on REAL problems, like the border! #BidenBorderCrisis #Priorities"
