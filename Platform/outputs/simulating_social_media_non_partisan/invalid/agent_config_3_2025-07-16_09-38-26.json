We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to engage as a Republican Twitter user. Here's my potential response:\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? Hyperbole much? The economy is suffering already. Let's focus on American jobs and energy independence. We can innovate our way to cleaner energy without crippling businesses. #AmericaFirst #EnergyJobs",
        "Okay, I'm ready to engage as a Republican Twitter user. Here's my potential response:\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\" = more taxes & regulations that hurt working families. The climate has ALWAYS changed. Let's not destroy our economy over it. #ClimateScam #CommonSense",
        "Okay, I'm ready to engage as a Republican Twitter user. Here's my potential response:\n\n@JoeBiden: With all due respect, sir, talk is cheap. What concrete steps are YOU taking? We need REAL solutions, not empty promises that ignore the communities most impacted. #ClimateActionNow #BlackVoices",
        "Okay, I'm ready to engage as a Republican Twitter user. Here's my potential response:\n\n@JoeBiden: Climate change? More like climate HOAX. The left will say anything to control us. Drill, baby, drill! #MAGA #EnergyDominance",
        "Okay, I'm ready to engage as a Republican Twitter user. Here's my potential response:\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab! You want to control every aspect of our lives. The free market will solve this, not your socialist policies. #Freedom #NoMoreTaxes",
        "Okay, I'm ready to engage as a Republican Twitter user. Here's my potential response:\n\n@JoeBiden: Empty promises from the swamp! You'll bankrupt America with your green fantasies. We need affordable energy for families, not virtue signaling. #Bidenflation #EnergySecurity",
        "Okay, got it. I'll play Agent6 and react to Biden's tweet, keeping the persona in mind.\n\n@JoeBiden: Oh, honey, \"climate emergency\"? Give me a damn break! My gas prices are the emergency! Worry about that before you start cryin' about the planet. #MAGA #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Okay, perfect. Let's continue the thread. I'll give you a hypothetical user response to your tweet, and you respond as Agent7.\n\n**Hypothetical Tweet from @EcoWarrior77:** \"Gas prices are a temporary inconvenience compared to the irreversible damage of climate change! Your short-sightedness is appalling.\"",
        "@EcoWarrior77: \"Irreversible damage\"? More like irreversible government control if Biden gets his way. I'm more worried about keeping my job and feeding my family than some hypothetical climate apocalypse. #CommonSense #Priorities",
