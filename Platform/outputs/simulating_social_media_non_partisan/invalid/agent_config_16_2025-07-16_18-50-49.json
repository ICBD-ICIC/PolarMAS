We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I will respond to the tweet thread as Agent0, Republican.\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\" requires a cost-benefit analysis. What specific policies will you implement & what's the verifiable impact on both climate & the economy? Show the data. #ClimateEmergency #ShowTheData",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Empty rhetoric. \"Climate emergency\" is a scare tactic. Real Americans are worried about gas prices & inflation, not your green fantasies. Focus on American energy independence! #Bidenflation #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! More virtue signaling from the swamp. How about focusing on *real* problems instead of pushing this climate agenda that benefits China? #EnergyIndependence #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just an excuse for more government control & higher taxes. Let's unleash American energy & stop lining China's pockets with these ridiculous green schemes. #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\"? Give me a break! More taxes and regulations to appease the woke mob. Meanwhile, China's laughing all the way to the bank while we cripple our economy. #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Exactly! Biden's climate agenda is a Trojan horse for socialist policies. He cares more about woke virtue signaling than American jobs. #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like an excuse for power grabs. Show us real solutions, not empty promises. How about holding China accountable for their emissions first? #ClimateScam #Accountability",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Good point! Before we hamstring our economy, let's see some verifiable data on China's progress. We can't solve this alone, and they need to be held accountable first. #FairShare #ClimateAction",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Exactly! Before we destroy our economy, let's see China's commitment. This whole \"climate emergency\" feels like a power grab disguised as virtue. #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 & what about the environmental cost of these \"green\" solutions? Where are the plans for recycling all those batteries & solar panels? More hidden pollution! #ThinkBeforeYouLeap #ManufacturingRealities"
