        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a climate overreaction! The economy is hurting enough already. More regulations will kill jobs. #ClimateScam #MAGA\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Funny how the \"urgent action\" always means higher taxes for hardworking Americans. Let's focus on real problems like inflation. #Bidenflation\n\nAgent0: Exactly! <user_name> This whole thing is a power grab. They want control over every aspect of our lives. #NoClimateTax #Freedom",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 Exactly. Been hearing this \"end of the world\" nonsense for decades. Still here. Let's prioritize affordable energy, not windmills that kill birds. #CommonSense",
