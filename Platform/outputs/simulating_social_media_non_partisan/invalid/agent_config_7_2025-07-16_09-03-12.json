We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready. Here's my response:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? We've been hearing that for decades. Remember the ice age scare? Let's focus on real problems, like the economy. Climate alarmism is just a power grab. #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1: <Agent0> Exactly! It's always \"the end is near!\" They use fear to control us. Meanwhile, gas prices are sky-high and the border is wide open. Fix THAT, @JoeBiden! #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent2: <Agent1> Amen! This climate nonsense is a distraction from the real issues hurting hard-working Americans. Biden's worried about the planet when he should be worried about our families. God help us. #MAGA",
        "Agent3: <Agent2> Exactly! This whole climate agenda is a Trojan Horse. It's about weakening America and enriching China. @JoeBiden is selling us out! #AmericaFirst #ClimateHoax",
        "Agent4: <Agent3> Selling us out is right! @JoeBiden's \"urgent action\" means more taxes for us and more money for his buddies in \"green\" energy. I'll take a climate denier over a wallet denier any day! #Bidenflation",
        "Agent5: <Agent4> You nailed it! All this climate talk is just a smokescreen for more government control and higher taxes. We need energy independence, not more regulations that kill jobs. #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent6: <Agent5> PREACH! I can barely afford groceries, thanks to Biden's policies. Now he wants to make gas even MORE expensive with this climate BS? How am I supposed to get to work? #FoodStamps #Bidenflation #ClimateScam",
        "Agent7: <Agent6> Exactly! He's clueless. Living in his ivory tower while we struggle. \"Urgent action\" means *we* pay the price. #EmptyShelvesBiden #OutOfTouch @JoeBiden",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Agree. \"Urgent action\" usually means inefficient spending. Let's explore practical, cost-effective solutions, like incentivizing fuel-efficient vehicles and optimizing existing infrastructure, instead of blanket regulations that hurt working families. #EfficiencyNotExtremism",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Fuel-efficient vehicles? That's what THEY want you to think! It's all a plot to control us. Do your research! The climate change narrative is a hoax. #DeepState #WakeUpSheeple"
