        "Agent2: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a climate power grab! The Lord gave us this Earth, and we'll use its resources. Worry about real problems, not this woke agenda. #MAGA #ClimateScam",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent taxes and regulations that kill American jobs. The climate has *always* changed. This is about control, not the planet. #WakeUpAmerica",

        "Agent6: @JoeBiden Climate change? How about climate *affordability*? My food stamps barely cover groceries, let alone \"green\" options. Fix the economy first! #Priorities #FoodNotFuel",
