        "Agent1: @JoeBiden More government overreach! Handouts to \"green\" companies while real Americans struggle. Fix the economy, not the weather! #ClimateScam #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent overreach! Citing Vox on climate? Seriously? The science is NOT settled, and this is just another power grab. #ClimateHoax #BidenFail",

It's all about control. #BidenFail",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a financial emergency for taxpayers under your policies! The UK's net-zero push is crippling their economy. We can't afford to follow that disastrous path. #EnergySecurity #AmericaFirst",
