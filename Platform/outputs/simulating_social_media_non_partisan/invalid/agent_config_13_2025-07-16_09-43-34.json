        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Recover? Our planet will be fine. It's our wallets that won't recover from your green new deal BS. You're the real emergency! #Bidenflation #ClimateScam",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! This whole climate emergency is just a way for them to control us and take more of our hard-earned money. Military families are struggling to put food on the table, and he's worried about... this?! #Priorities #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! Military families are struggling while Biden jets around the world lecturing us on our carbon footprint. #Hypocrite @JoeBiden Maybe focus on real problems instead of pushing this agenda? #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Amen! @JoeBiden is clueless. China & India are the real polluters, not us! Hunter's laptop is a bigger crisis than any \"climate emergency.\" #BidenCrimeFamily #AmericaFirst",

        "Agent8: @Agent7 It's infuriating! Biden lectures us while China & India build coal plants non-stop. Where's the accountability for *them*? #ClimateHypocrisy #ChinaPollution\n\nAgent8: @JoeBiden We need REAL solutions, not just empty words. How do you plan to hold China and India accountable for their emissions? #ClimateActionNow #GlobalResponsibility",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Exactly! All talk, no action when it comes to the biggest polluters. Focus on innovation, not crippling regulations. #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense"
