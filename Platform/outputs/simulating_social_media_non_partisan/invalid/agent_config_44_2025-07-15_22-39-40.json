        "@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? Please. Focus on real issues like the border crisis and inflation. American families are struggling NOW. We need practical solutions, not more government overreach. #Bidenflation #EnergyIndependence",

        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Oh, so NOW you care about urgent action? How about the urgent action needed to secure our borders? Or the urgent action to stop this ridiculous inflation you helped create? #EmptyPromises #Priorities",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse for higher taxes and regulations! Let's not pretend windmills will solve anything when China's building coal plants left and right. #CommonSense #EnergyReality",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab. I trust my own research, and the \"science\" is always changing to fit the narrative. Let's focus on affordable energy and real solutions that don't kill jobs. #MAGA #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden And what about the impact of your climate policies on Central American Latinos? Natural gas is a bridge, not the enemy! What about your advisor's ties to gas companies? #Accountability #EnergyForAll",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden So, \"urgent action\" for the climate while flying around in a private jet? How much carbon does that emit? Maybe lead by example before lecturing us. #Hypocrisy #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden: \"Never recover\"? Hyperbole much? How about urgent action to protect our children? What kind of message are you sending? #ProtectOurChildren #PrioritiesMatter",
        "Agent8: @Agent5: Exactly! We need affordable energy for ALL, especially for the Latino community. Demonizing natural gas hurts working families. Let's focus on real solutions that benefit everyone. #EnergyForAll #CommonSense",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Exactly! And the left demonizes anyone who questions their agenda. They're so out of touch with reality. #EnergyForAll #CommonSense"
