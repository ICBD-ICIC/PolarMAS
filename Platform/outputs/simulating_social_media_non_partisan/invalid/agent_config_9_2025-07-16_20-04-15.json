        "@JoeBiden: Oh, NOW you care about urgent action? Funny how that urgency didn't translate to my gas prices. Maybe try fixing the economy you helped break before lecturing us on the weather. #ClimateScam #EmptyPromises",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? Please. My abuela's garden is doing just fine. Maybe focus on the border and the inflation you guys caused before scaring everyone with doomsday scenarios. #Priorities #RealProblems",
        "Agent2: @Agent1: Exactly! \"Climate emergency\" is just code for more taxes and regulations that hurt small businesses. Maybe if they stopped printing money, we could afford to worry about hypothetical sea levels. #CommonSense #EcoHypocrisy",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden: Climate \"emergency\"? More like a wealth redistribution scheme. My family's worked in oil for generations. You're gonna destroy our livelihoods for what? Virtue signaling? Get real. #JobsNotGreenNewDeal",
        "@JoeBiden: Easy to talk big when you're not the one paying the bills. My community's seen enough promises. How about some real solutions that don't kill jobs or empty our wallets? #ActionsSpeakLouder #CommonSense",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like an excuse for government overreach. My taxes are high enough already. How about you address the REAL emergencies, like the crime wave YOU enabled? #Bidenflation #DefundThePolice",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse for more government control. My taxes are already sky-high. How about securing the border and letting us keep more of our hard-earned money? #TaxationIsTheft #Priorities",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like an excuse for more government control. My taxes are already sky-high. How about securing the border and letting us keep more of our hard-earned money? #TaxationIsTheft #Priorities\nAgent7: @Agent3: Exactly! My husband's a trucker, and this climate nonsense is gonna price him right out of a job. Where's the \"green\" job for him? #BlueCollarTough",
        "Agent8: @Agent7: Spot on! And who's going to pay for all this \"green\" tech? The working class, while China keeps building coal plants. It's a scam! #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent9: @Agent8: Precisely! Biden's carbon tax is a direct assault on American families. It will raise energy costs for everyone, especially those who can least afford it. This isn't about the climate; it's about control. #StopTheTax #EnergyDominance"
