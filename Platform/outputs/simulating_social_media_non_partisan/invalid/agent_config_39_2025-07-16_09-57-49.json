We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\" often translates to policies that hurt working families and benefit elites. Before we rush into anything, let's have a real discussion about the costs and benefits for everyone, not just those on the coasts. #ClimateDebate #EnergyJobs",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden Seriously? More regulations that kill jobs and raise prices? How about focusing on real solutions that don't punish Americans? #ClimateScam #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent2:@Agent1: Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just a smokescreen for more government control. Let's unleash American energy, not cripple it with green fantasies. #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA",
        "Agent3:@Agent2: Couldn't agree more. Biden's policies are a direct attack on our livelihoods. My family depends on the coal industry. Where are our jobs going to come from when he shuts it all down? #SaveCoal #EnergyJobs",
        "Agent4: @Agent3: Amen! They don't care about OUR jobs, just lining their own pockets with green scams. Coal keeps the lights on, and Biden wants to leave us in the dark! #Trump2024 #NoGreenNewDeal",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 All this talk about \"existential threats\" is overblown. The climate has always changed. Let's focus on affordable energy and American jobs. #EnergySecurity #CommonSense",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 While climate change is real, the proposed \"solutions\" often miss the mark. Let's invest in *innovation* \u2013 cleaner coal tech, nuclear \u2013 instead of bankrupting industries. #EnergyInnovation #ClimateSolutions",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Investing in innovation is key! Cleaner coal tech is a real solution, unlike these \"green scams.\" We need affordable energy that creates jobs, not destroys them. #EnergyInnovation #AmericanJobs",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden, \"climate emergency\"? More like a wealth redistribution scheme! Your policies will decimate our economy. #TrumpWasRight #MAGA",
        "Agent9:@Agent8: Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" is a joke. The climate's always changing, and these policies will only destroy jobs. We need to unleash American energy, not cripple it! #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA"
