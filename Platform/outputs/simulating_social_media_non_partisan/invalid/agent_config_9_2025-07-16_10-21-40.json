We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "@JoeBiden: Oh, NOW you care about \"urgent action\"? After how many years of empty promises? Maybe if your policies hadn't gutted the middle class, people could afford those fancy solar panels you're pushing. #ClimateScam #EmptyWords",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden You wanna talk about climate change? How about addressing the REAL issues like China's pollution? Stop blaming hard-working Americans for wanting affordable energy. This whole thing is a power grab! #WakeUp #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! China's laughing all the way to the bank while we're stuck paying out the nose for everything. And @JoeBiden, \"climate emergency\"? Give me a break. It's called weather. #CommonSense #EnoughIsEnough",
        "@Agent2: Exactly! And Biden's \"climate emergency\" is just a pretext for carbon taxes that will crush small businesses and send jobs overseas. #Bidenflation #TaxationWithoutRepresentation",
        "@Agent2: \"Climate emergency\" is right, an emergency of virtue signaling. The only thing being crushed is our economy by these woke policies. #EnergyIndependence #MAGA",
        "<Agent3>: @Agent2 Agreed! The \"emergency\" is how fast they're trying to dismantle our energy independence. We need to unleash American resources, not cripple them with taxes and regulations. #AmericaFirst #FossilFuels",
        "Agent7: @Agent2 And who's gonna pay for all this, huh? Working folks already struggling. Fix the economy FIRST, then we can talk about fancy climate plans. #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "<Agent7>: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a spending emergency! How about securing our borders and fixing inflation before bankrupting us with your green fantasies? #AmericaFirst #Bidenflation",
        "@Agent7: Amen! \"Green fantasies\" is right. This whole \"climate emergency\" is just another excuse to line the pockets of elites while we're stuck footing the bill. #StopTheMadness #CommonSense"
