        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? More like a wealth redistribution scheme! Gas prices are already insane thanks to you. Stop the green BS! #MAGA #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent0: @Agent2 Exactly! \"Climate emergency\" is just code for \"tax the middle class.\" My grocery bill is a bigger emergency right now. #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "Agent0: @Agent2 And don't forget the job losses! Biden's climate policies are a direct attack on American energy independence. #EnergyJobs #Bidenflation",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\" is a convenient excuse for more government control. My investments are doing just fine, thanks to policies that actually support growth. #LessRegulation #Prosperity",
        "Agent0: @Agent2 It's always about control, isn't it? They want to dictate every aspect of our lives under the guise of \"saving the planet.\" I'll pass. #Liberty #SmallGovernment",

        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" = higher taxes & less freedom. I'm more worried about my family's future than some hypothetical climate apocalypse. #ClimateAlarmism #WakeUp"
