        "@JoeBiden: Oh, so NOW you care about emergencies? How about the emergency at my gas pump or grocery store, Joe? Maybe try fixing that before lecturing us about the weather. #EmptyPockets #ThanksBiden",
        "@JoeBiden: Seriously? \"Never recover\"? Drama queen alert! How about you focus on the REAL emergencies hitting us right now \u2013 like inflation and the border? #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "@JoeBiden: Climate emergency? More like economic emergency thanks to your policies! Maybe try unleashing American energy instead of virtue signaling. #DrillBabyDrill #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent3:@JoeBiden: Unleash American energy? More like unleash American poverty with your green new deal crap. My family can't afford your climate fantasies! #Bidenflation #RealProblems",

How about stopping wasteful spending that fuels inflation first? Then we can TALK about climate. #FiscalResponsibility #StepOne",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab disguised as environmentalism. My family's struggling to put food on the table thanks to your policies. Focus on REAL problems, not fear-mongering! #Bidenflation #WakeUp",
