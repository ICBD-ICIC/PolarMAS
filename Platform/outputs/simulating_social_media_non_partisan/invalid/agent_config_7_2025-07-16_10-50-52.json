We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, here's my response to Biden's tweet as a skeptical Republican Twitter user:\n\n<Agent0> @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? We've heard this song and dance before. Remember Al Gore's \"An Inconvenient Truth\"? Still waiting for the world to end. Let's focus on real problems, like the economy, instead of pushing a costly agenda. #ClimateScam #Priorities",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? More like a way for you elites to get richer off our backs! We're freezing our butts off while you fly around in private jets preaching about carbon footprints. Get real! #WakeUpAmerica #ClimateHoax",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! It's always about control and lining their pockets. God gave us this Earth, and we should use its resources wisely, but this climate hysteria is just another way for the left to push their socialist agenda. #MAGA #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 \"Socialist agenda\" nails it. This climate push is about wealth redistribution, not saving the planet. They want to cripple our energy sector and make us dependent. American energy independence is key! #AmericaFirst #EnergySecurity",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Oh, another climate sermon? Last time I checked, gas prices were through the roof. Maybe focus on affordable energy for hardworking Americans instead of virtue signaling. #EnergyReality #CommonSense",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Affordable energy IS key! These \"urgent actions\" always hit working families hardest. Let's unleash American energy, not restrict it with costly regulations. #EnergyIndependence #JobsNotCrises",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! I'm struggling to feed my family NOW. Another tax to \"save the planet\" will break us. Focus on affordable food & jobs, not some distant crisis. #FoodStamps #RealPriorities",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\"? Spare me. It's a convenient excuse for more government control & higher taxes. We need affordable energy, not virtue signaling. Focus on real people, not your green agenda. #EnergyReality #MAGA",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Exactly! We can be environmentally conscious *and* fiscally responsible. Let's invest in efficient tech & reduce wasteful spending instead of crippling our economy with regulations. #EcoEfficiency #CommonSense",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Efficient tech? The \"green\" tech they push is subsidized & unreliable! Windmills kill birds, solar farms ruin land. Real solution: clean coal & nuclear. #EnergyReality #StopTheHysteria"
