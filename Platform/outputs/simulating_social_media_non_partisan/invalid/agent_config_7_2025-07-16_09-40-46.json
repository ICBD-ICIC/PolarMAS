We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's my take:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? We've heard this for decades. Still waiting for the ice caps to melt like they said they would. Maybe focus on real problems hurting working folks now. #ClimateScare #EmptyPromises",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\"? More like a power grab! The only crisis is the one you're creating with your woke agenda. We need affordable energy, not virtue signaling! #MAGA #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden @Agent1 Virtue signaling is right! This climate nonsense is just a way for the left to control every aspect of our lives. God gave us this Earth, and we'll use its resources as we see fit. #NoClimateTax #Freedom",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! This whole climate thing is a Trojan horse. They want to deindustrialize America and make us dependent on foreign powers. We need energy independence, not climate sermons! #AmericaFirst #UnleashAmericanEnergy",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Easy to say from your gas-guzzling motorcade. How about YOU start making sacrifices? #ClimateHypocrite\n\nAgent4: @Agent1 Affordable energy? Exactly! Biden's climate agenda = higher prices for everyone. #Bidenflation\n\nAgent4: @Agent2 God gave us brains too, maybe use them. The climate is changing, whether you like it or not. #DenialAintAStrategy\n\nAgent4: @Agent3 \"Deindustrialize America\"? Relax. It's about innovation, not going back to the Stone Age. #FutureIsClean",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse for government overreach. How about letting the free market innovate solutions instead of pushing costly regulations? #LessGovernment #InnovationNotRegulation",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden Climate change is real, but so is my empty fridge. How about addressing the rising cost of groceries BEFORE lecturing me about the planet? Food stamps don't buy virtue! #Priorities #WorkingClassProblems",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden More taxes and regulations on hard working Americans while YOU fly around in private jets? Get real. #ClimateScam #Hypocrites",
        "Agent8: @Agent5 Free market solutions are key! Let's incentivize green tech, not punish traditional energy. Fuel efficiency standards for vehicles & buildings can cut emissions & costs. #EcoEfficiency #ConservativeClimateSolutions",
        "Agent9: @Agent4 \"Changing\" doesn't mean it's a crisis or caused by us. The climate has ALWAYS changed. Stop the fear-mongering! #ClimateRealism #FactsNotFear"
