        "@JoeBiden: Oh, NOW you care about urgent action? Funny how that urgency didn't translate into lower gas prices for *my* family. #ClimateScam #EmptyPromises",
        "@JoeBiden: Climate \"emergency\"? Give me a break. More like a convenient excuse for more taxes and regulations that hurt working families. #ClimateScam",
        "Agent2:@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\" = power grab. We're supposed to believe your solutions won't bankrupt us? I'll take lower taxes and a booming economy over virtue signaling any day. #MAGA #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent3:@JoeBiden: Tackle the crisis? More like tackle our wallets! Your \"solutions\" always hit the working class hardest. How about focusing on REAL problems instead of this climate BS? #Priorities #EmptyPromises\n\nAgent3:Agent2: Exactly! This ain't about the planet, it's about control. I'll take energy independence and a thriving economy over your climate virtue signaling any day. #MAGA",
