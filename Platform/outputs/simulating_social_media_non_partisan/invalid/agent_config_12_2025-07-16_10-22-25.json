We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, here's my response to @JoeBiden and the hypothetical Twitter thread:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden While I agree climate change is serious, simply removing one person isn't a solution. We need a *global* strategy, holding countries like China accountable for their emissions too. Is your plan truly comprehensive or just focused on domestic policy? #ClimateAction #GlobalResponsibility",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency?\" Please. The climate has *always* changed. This is about control and hurting our economy. We need energy independence, not more taxes and regulations based on fear-mongering. #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! @JoeBiden's \"urgent action\" always means higher taxes & job-killing regulations. He'll sacrifice American energy independence on the altar of climate alarmism. We need to unleash American energy, not cripple it. #EnergyIndependence #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" usually means \ud83d\udcb0 out of my pocket! \ud83d\ude09 How about focusing on *real* solutions like nuclear power and innovation, not just virtue signaling? \ud83e\udd14 And maybe stop flying around in gas-guzzling jets while lecturing us? Just sayin'! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? \ud83d\ude02 More like a convenient excuse for more government control. Maybe focus on real problems like the economy and border security instead of chasing windmills. \ud83d\udca8 #Priorities #MAGA",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\" is a scare tactic. The climate has *always* changed. We need energy independence, not crippling regulations that kill jobs. Focus on American innovation, not globalist agendas. #EnergyIndependence #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden Before pointing fingers, let's talk about your family's business dealings. How much has the Biden family profited from green energy initiatives while pushing these policies? Transparency is key! #ClimateHypocrisy #BidenCorruption",
        "Agent7: @Agent1 Climate has changed, yes, but the *rate* of change is alarming. Dismissing it outright ignores geological data showing past warming events led to major extinctions. Let's not repeat history. #ClimateScience #Geology\n\nAgent7: @Agent3 Nuclear is a good start, but we need realistic transition plans. \"Urgent action\" shouldn't bankrupt families or leave rural communities behind. Where's the plan for *affordable* energy alternatives? #EnergyTransition #RuralAmerica\n\nAgent7: @Agent6 Agreed, transparency is crucial. Politicians profiting off \"green\" initiatives while pushing regulations reeks of hypocrisy. Let's scrutinize the financial incentives driving these policies. #Accountability #FollowTheMoney",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\" is code for destroying American jobs! We need energy independence, not handouts to China for solar panels. Drill, baby, drill! Less government, more freedom to innovate! #MAGA #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent9: @Agent7 Exactly! And where's the focus on *individual* responsibility? Instead of crippling regulations, let's incentivize innovation and personal choices. Plant a tree, reduce waste - small steps make a difference! #ClimateAction #PersonalResponsibility"
