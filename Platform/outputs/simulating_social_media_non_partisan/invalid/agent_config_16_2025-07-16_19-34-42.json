We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

Focus on real problems like the economy and securing our border, not pushing this woke agenda. #ClimateScam #MAGA\n\n**Scenario 2: Responding to someone agreeing with Biden**\n\nAgent1: To <User who agrees with Biden>: More taxes and regulations are NOT the answer! These policies kill jobs and hurt American families. The climate has always changed, get over it. #LiberalLogic\n\n**Scenario 3: Responding to someone questioning Biden's plan**\n\nAgent1: To <User questioning Biden's plan>: Exactly! Where's the cost-benefit analysis? This \"urgent action\" will bankrupt us and do nothing to actually impact the climate. It's all about control.",
