We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, here's how I, as Agent0, would respond to that tweet and any subsequent replies, keeping in mind my character's traits:\n\n**Initial Response:**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent spending! The planet's been around longer than you, Joe. This \"crisis\" is just another excuse for higher taxes and control. #ClimateScam #TaxpayerRipoff\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@EcoWarrior: \"It's not about taxes, it's about our children's future! Ignoring climate change is irresponsible.\"\n\n**Agent0's response to @EcoWarrior:**\n\nAgent0: @EcoWarrior My kids will be just fine if I'm not broke from paying for your virtue signaling. The climate's always changing! Focus on real problems, like the border. #WakeUp #CommonSense\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@ScienceFacts: \"97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and human-caused.\"\n\n**Agent0's response to @ScienceFacts (and maybe @JoeBiden):**\n\nAgent0: @ScienceFacts 97% of scientists also need funding to keep their jobs. Show me real, unbiased data. This whole thing is a political power grab! @JoeBiden #FakeNews #DoYourResearch",
        "Okay, here's my response as Agent1 to the initial tweet and possible follow-ups:\n\n**Initial Response:**\n\nAgent1: @JoeBiden Oh, here we go again. \"Climate emergency\"? Sounds like another excuse to line politicians' pockets. The planet will be fine. It's *my* wallet I'm worried about! #CommonSense #EnoughIsEnough\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@EcoWarrior: \"It's not about taxes, it's about our children's future! Ignoring climate change is irresponsible.\"\n\n**Agent1's response to @EcoWarrior:**\n\nAgent1: @EcoWarrior My kid's future depends on a strong economy, not windmills! Let's focus on affordable energy and real jobs. This climate stuff is just hurting working families. #Priorities #JobsFirst\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@ScienceFacts: \"97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and human-caused.\"\n\n**Agent1's response to @ScienceFacts (and maybe @JoeBiden):**\n\nAgent1: @ScienceFacts \"97%\"? Yeah, sure they do. Who's paying for these studies? I'll believe it when I see real solutions that don't bankrupt us. @JoeBiden #ShowMeTheData #Skeptical",
        "Okay, here's my response as Agent2 to the initial tweet and possible follow-ups:\n\n**Initial Response:**\n\nAgent2: @JoeBiden Oh, NOW you care about emergencies? How about the emergency at my bank account after these past few years? Maybe fix that before lecturing us on the weather, Grandpa. #EmptyPockets #ThanksJoe\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@EcoWarrior: \"It's not about taxes, it's about our children's future! Ignoring climate change is irresponsible.\"\n\n**Agent2's response to @EcoWarrior:**\n\nAgent2: @EcoWarrior My kid's future is looking pretty bleak thanks to policies YOU support. Worry about your own silver-spoon-fed children. I'm trying to keep a roof over ours. #RealityCheck #Unaffordable\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@ScienceFacts: \"97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and human-caused.\"\n\n**Agent2's response to @ScienceFacts (and maybe @JoeBiden):**\n\nAgent2: @ScienceFacts 97% paid by the same people who benefit from this nonsense. My \"carbon footprint\" is the least of my worries. Try affording groceries first, then lecture me. @JoeBiden #Priorities #OutofTouch",
        "Okay, here's my response as Agent3 to the initial tweet and possible follow-ups:\n\n**Initial Response:**\n\nAgent3: @JoeBiden Climate emergency my BLACK ASS! You lying son of a bitch!

Real problems. #Priorities #EnoughAlready\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@EcoWarrior: \"It's not about taxes, it's about our children's future! Ignoring climate change is irresponsible.\"\n\n**Agent4's response to @EcoWarrior:**\n\nAgent4: @EcoWarrior My kids' future depends on me being able to afford groceries, not some feel-good climate project that'll bankrupt us all.

Okay, and how much funding do they get for saying that? Show me some unbiased data that doesn't involve a tax hike. @JoeBiden #Skeptical #ShowMeTheMoney",
        "Okay, here's my response as Agent5 to the initial tweet and possible follow-ups:\n\n**Initial Response:**\n\nAgent5: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"?

        "Okay, here's my response as Agent6 to the initial tweet and possible follow-ups:\n\n**Initial Response:**\n\nAgent6: @JoeBiden Urgent action? Says the guy who can't even control inflation! How much more of our money are you going to throw at this hoax? Show us the REAL data, not just your talking points. #ClimateScam #AccountabilityNow\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@EcoWarrior: \"It's not about taxes, it's about our children's future!

        "Okay, here's my response as Agent8 to the initial tweet and possible follow-ups:\n\n**Initial Response:**\n\nAgent8: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Reminds me of Castro blaming the US for everything. Always someone else's fault, right? More regulations, less freedom. #SocialistAgenda #ClimateScam\n\n**Example of a follow-up tweet from another user:**\n\n@EcoWarrior: \"It's not about taxes, it's about our children's future!
