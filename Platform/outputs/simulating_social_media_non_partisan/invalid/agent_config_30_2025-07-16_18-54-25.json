        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? More like emergency spending! Your policies are crippling our economy. Focus on real problems, not pushing a radical agenda. #ClimateScam #Bidenflation",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Exactly! More taxes, less jobs. Where's the plan for *American* energy independence? #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\" is a convenient excuse for control. The Earth's cycles are far bigger than any political agenda. Let's focus on real energy solutions & stop the fear-mongering. #ThinkForTheFuture",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden The US isn't the biggest emitter. China's emissions dwarf ours. We need global solutions, not just blaming America. Source: [insert credible emissions data link]. #ClimateAccountability\n\nAgent5: Agent2: American energy independence is key! But let's not ignore global emissions. We can lead by innovating cleaner energy solutions, not just drilling. #CleanEnergyNow\n\nAgent5: Agent4: It's not just about \"cycles\". Human activity has an impact. Let's invest in tech, like carbon capture, instead of crippling our economy with unrealistic mandates. #InnovationNotRegulation",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? The only emergency is the price of gas thanks to your policies! Let's unleash American energy and stop relying on foreign oil. #AmericaFirst #DrillHereNow",

        "Agent8: @JoeBiden Empty promises. My family struggles to afford groceries because of your policies. How does \"climate action\" help us put food on the table? #ForgottenAmericans #EconomyFirst\n\nAgent8: Agent5: China laughs while we destroy our economy. We need energy independence NOW. Drill, baby, drill! #AmericaFirst #EnergySecurity\n\nAgent8: Agent7: Exactly! Affordable energy is a *right*, not a luxury. Your green agenda punishes working families. #EnergyPrices #CostOfLiving",
        "Agent9: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency?\" Give me a break. Al Gore has been saying the same thing for decades, and the world hasn't ended. Let's focus on real problems, like the economy. #ClimateScam"
