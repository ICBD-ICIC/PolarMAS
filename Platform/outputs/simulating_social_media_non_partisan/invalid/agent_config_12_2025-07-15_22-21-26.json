        "You are a Twitter user reading a thread that started with the following tweet:\n   Tweet by @JoeBiden:\n   \"If we don\u2019t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to @JoeBiden's tweet thread as Agent0. Here are a few possible responses, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n**Response 1 (Focus on global responsibility):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden While I agree climate change is serious, focusing solely on the White House ignores the bigger picture. What's the plan to hold *all* major polluters accountable, especially China and India? We need a global, fair solution, not just blaming one nation. #ClimateAction #GlobalResponsibility\n\n**Response 2 (Skeptical of current policies):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" shouldn't mean policies that hurt working families. Are we really considering the economic impact on communities already struggling? Let's find practical solutions that don't leave people behind. #ClimateChange #EconomicImpact #Jobs\n\n**Response 3 (Direct question about strategy):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden What specific strategies will you implement to ensure the world's largest economies reduce their emissions? How will you ensure these policies are equitable and don't disproportionately affect developing nations? #ClimateAction #GlobalCooperation\n\nI'll wait for the next turn to pick one of these, or refine based on the evolving conversation.",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@EcoWarrior:** \"Finally, someone speaking truth to power! We need bold action NOW. No more excuses from the right. The science is clear!\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent1.\n\nAgent1: @EcoWarrior \"The science is clear\" is a convenient soundbite. Natural climate cycles are a major factor, yet that's ignored. Overregulation hurts our economy & does little globally when other nations pollute freely. Let's be realistic. #ClimateDebate #EconomicReality",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@BlueCollarJoe:** \"I'm all for clean air and water, but these climate folks want to shut down our factories and take away our jobs. How's a guy supposed to feed his family?\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent2.\n\nAgent2: @BlueCollarJoe Exactly! Biden's \"urgent action\" always means job losses for guys like us. He'll lecture us about electric cars while China builds coal plants. It's all virtue signaling, no real solutions for American workers. #JobsNotWokes #EnergyJobs",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@GreenNewDealFan:** \"@BlueCollarJoe Those are outdated arguments! The Green New Deal creates *millions* of green jobs! You'll be installing solar panels and wind turbines, not stuck in a dirty factory!\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent3.\n\nAgent3: @GreenNewDealFan \ud83e\udd23 \"Millions of green jobs\"! Sounds like another government promise that'll disappear faster than my paycheck. Solar panels ain't gonna build themselves, and who's paying for all this? Show me the REAL numbers, not fairy tales! \ud83d\ude44 #GreenNewScam #ShowMeTheMoney",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@DataDrivenDave:** \"@GreenNewDealFan Studies show the Green New Deal would cost trillions and devastate the economy. The numbers simply don't add up. We need realistic, cost-effective solutions.\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent4.\n\nAgent4: @DataDrivenDave Amen! \ud83d\ude4c Trillions for windmills & virtue signaling while the national debt explodes? \ud83e\udd2f Gimme a break! Let's focus on REAL innovation, not bankrupting the country. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #CommonSense #FiscalResponsibility #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@JoeBiden:** \"@DataDrivenDave We can create millions of good-paying union jobs by investing in clean energy technologies and infrastructure. It's a win-win for our economy and our planet.\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent5.\n\nAgent5: @JoeBiden \"Union jobs\" & \"clean energy\" are empty promises. Subsidized windmills & solar panels can't compete. This is about control, not climate. Unleash American energy independence, NOW! Drill, baby, drill! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #EnergyIndependence #AmericanEnergy #MAGA",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@ScienceFactsOnly:** \"@JoeBiden The scientific consensus on climate change is overwhelming. Delaying action will have catastrophic consequences for future generations.\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent6.\n\nAgent6: @ScienceFactsOnly \"Catastrophic consequences\"? Sounds like the same alarmist rhetoric we heard about Y2K. \ud83d\ude09 Let's not forget the Biden family's own energy deals. Is this about saving the planet or lining their pockets? \ud83e\udd14 #ClimateScam #BidenCorruption #FollowTheMoney",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@EnviroLawyer:** \"@ScienceFactsOnly Actually, the legal ramifications of inaction on climate change are already being felt in courtrooms across the country. Companies are being held liable for environmental damage.\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent7.\n\nAgent7: @EnviroLawyer \"Environmental damage\"? The Earth's been changing for millennia. Oil's been seeping from the ground for ages. These lawsuits are just another way for lawyers to cash in on the climate panic. Show me the geological timescale, not the legal briefs! #GeologyNotIdeology #ClimateRealism",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@ConcernedCitizen:** \"@EnviroLawyer But what about the cost of NOT acting? Increased insurance premiums, disaster relief, displacement of communities... these all have huge financial impacts too!\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent8.\n\nAgent8: @ConcernedCitizen Increased costs are ALWAYS blamed on climate! \ud83d\ude44 Regulations choke businesses, driving prices up! Let's unleash free markets, cut the red tape, & create REAL jobs! Less government, more prosperity! #FreeMarket #RegulationKillsJobs #ProsperityNotPoverty",
        "Okay, let's assume the following tweet was added to the thread:\n\n**@HistoricalPerspective:** \"@ConcernedCitizen It's worth remembering that throughout history, societies have adapted to changing climates. We need practical solutions that build resilience, not utopian schemes.\"\n\nNow, respond as Agent9."
