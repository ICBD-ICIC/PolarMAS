        "Okay, here's my response to Biden's tweet and the Twitter thread:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden You call it a climate emergency? More like a socialist power grab! The economy will CRASH with your Green New Deal nonsense. Trump knew what was up! #MAGA #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" = bankrupting the country. We can't afford your climate fantasies. Focus on real problems like inflation and the border. #Bidenflation #BuildBackBroke",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Seriously? Citing Vox on climate? That's your \"urgent action\"? The American people aren't buying your agenda, especially when you push it with biased sources. Get real! #ClimateHoax #BidenFails",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? More like a joke! You're gonna destroy American jobs with your woke agenda. Go back to Delaware! #BidenIsAFailure #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break! It's just a way for the radical left to control every aspect of our lives. We need energy independence, not more government overreach. #AmericaFirst #FakeNews\n\nAgent4: The so-called \"climate crisis\" is a Trojan horse for socialism. They want to destroy our economy and freedom in the name of saving the planet. I'm not falling for it. #WakeUpAmerica\n\nAgent4: @Agent0 You're right! The Green New Deal is a disaster waiting to happen. It's all about control, not climate. #MAGA #TrumpWasRight",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Spot on! This \"climate emergency\" is just a smokescreen for more government control. It's about killing American energy and lining the pockets of elites. #EnergyIndependence #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a wealth transfer scheme! You're choking American energy while China laughs all the way to the bank. Get your priorities straight! #BidenIsALaughingstock #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden Look at the UK's \"net zero\" disaster! Skyrocketing energy prices, people choosing between heating and eating. Is that your plan for America? #EnergyReality #ClimateScam",
        "Agent4: @Agent7 Exactly! Biden's policies are a carbon copy of that disaster. We need American energy, not European-style poverty. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden More like a power grab using fear. The climate has ALWAYS changed. Stop the radical agenda that hurts REAL Americans! #EnergyReality #ClimateScam"
