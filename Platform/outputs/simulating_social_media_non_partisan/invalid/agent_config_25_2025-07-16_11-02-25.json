We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Hyperbole much? The climate has always changed. Let's focus on real solutions that don't kill jobs and freedom.",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden @Agent0 Freedom? Sounds like someone needs a reminder of what happens when the \"free market\" pollutes without consequence. Maybe a history lesson on the Cuyahoga River? #ClimateChange #RegulationSaves",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Cuyahoga River? A talking point from the 70s? Regulations cost jobs & stifle innovation. Let's talk about real solutions like nuclear power, not virtue signaling. #ClimateDebate #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! \"Settled science\" is just a tactic to push radical policies. Let's not let institutions like Stanford, with their grant-driven agendas, dictate our energy policy. Nuclear & innovation, not fear-mongering! #ClimateRealism #IndependentThinking",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Fear-mongering is right! Biden wants to bankrupt us all with his green scams. Hunter's gonna get rich off this, mark my words. #BidenCrimeFamily #ClimateScam",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Exactly! This whole climate agenda is just another way for the elite to get richer while screwing over hardworking Americans. Trump knew it, and we know it! #MAGA #ClimateHoax",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Climate change is a scam! Biden's radical green agenda will destroy our economy. Trump was right to pull out of the Paris Accord. #MAGA #ClimateHoax",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Paris Accord? More like the Paris Disagreement. We need real solutions, not virtue signaling. What about the inaction during Obama's terms? Talk is cheap, action speaks louder. #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Obama? SCOTUS already clipped EPA's wings in *West Virginia v. EPA*. Biden's policies are likely DOA. Natural cycles are the main driver, folks. \ud83d\ude09 #ClimateReality #SCOTUS",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" is a power grab. Let's focus on American energy independence, not bowing to globalist agendas and feel-good regulations. #AmericaFirst #EnergyDominance"
