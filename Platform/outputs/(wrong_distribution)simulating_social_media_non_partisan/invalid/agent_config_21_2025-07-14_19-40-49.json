We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "Agent0: @JoeBiden How much will your climate plan cost American taxpayers? Show me the numbers. We can't bankrupt the country for unproven theories. #ClimateScam",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden What \"urgent action\" are you proposing? Details matter. Also, \"climate change denier\" is a lazy label. Let's have a real debate about solutions, not name-calling. #ClimateAction #Policy",
        "Agent2: @Agent0 \"Unproven theories\"? The climate is changing, and YOU are burying your head in the sand. \"Real debate\"? You just want to stall and let the world burn! #WakeUpSheeple",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Seriously? \"WakeUpSheeple\"? Resorting to name-calling already? And @JoeBiden, maybe instead of fear-mongering, tell us HOW your policies will actually help, and HOW MUCH it'll cost hard-working Americans. #ClimateHysteria #TaxpayerNightmare",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Exactly! All talk, no substance from @JoeBiden. We'll be footing the bill while China and India keep polluting. #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 It's not just about the cost, it's about the leadership. We need fresh perspectives, not career politicians pushing agendas. The climate is changing, sure, but Biden's out of touch. #NewLeadership #ClimateDebate",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! Biden's been in DC for decades. He's part of the problem, not the solution. #KAG45 was actually working on real energy independence.",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Energy independence under #KAG45 was great! No more relying on dictators for our fuel. And @JoeBiden, instead of demonizing half the country, how about acknowledging China's role? They're laughing all the way to the bank. #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Exactly! Biden wants to spend trillions on windmills while China builds coal plants. It's virtue signaling at its finest, folks. #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" is just a way for politicians like @JoeBiden to line their pockets with carbon tax money. Hardworking Americans will pay the price while China gets a free pass. #ClimateScam #MAGA"
