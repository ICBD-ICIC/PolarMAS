        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Oh, so NOW you care about emergencies? What about the emergency at the gas pump thanks to YOUR policies? GTFO with this climate BS.",

        "Agent0: @JoeBiden And what \"urgent action\" involves bankrupting the middle class, huh? Another tax hike disguised as saving the planet? I'm calling BS. #TaxTheRichFirst",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Nah, more like a power grab disguised as saving the planet. My truck ain't runnin' on fairy dust, and my taxes ain't payin' for virtue signaling. #DrillBabyDrill"
