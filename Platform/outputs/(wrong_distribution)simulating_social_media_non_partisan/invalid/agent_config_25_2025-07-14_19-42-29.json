We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, here's my response to that tweet thread, keeping in mind my persona:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break. The climate's always changing. More government control isn't the answer. Let's focus on real problems, not pushing a radical agenda. Individual freedom & innovation, not alarmism, will solve any challenges.",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent spending on pet projects disguised as climate solutions. Maybe focus on energy independence instead of virtue signaling? #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! \"Climate emergency\" = open checkbook for the elite. How about we unleash American energy instead of crippling it? #CommonSense",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Couldn't agree more. This \"settled science\" nonsense is just a way to shut down debate and push through radical policies. They get grant money to \"prove\" their point, then act like anyone who disagrees is a moron. Independent thought is dead, thanks to these institutions.",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a wealth transfer scheme! The only thing dying is our economy under your policies. #Bidenflation Focus on REAL issues, like the border crisis you created.",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden Climate change is a HOAX! You're trying to scare people into giving up their freedoms. Trump knew what was up. #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency?\" It's a scare tactic! The Dems want control, not solutions. Let's unleash American energy and stop the virtue signaling. #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden Seen this movie before. Promises, promises. Where was this urgency decades ago? Tired of the political games. Show me real action, not just empty words and more taxes. #ClimateHysteria #ActionsSpeakLouder",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden \"Planet may never recover\"? Dramatic much? Last I checked, the Supreme Court put a damper on your EPA overreach. Natural cycles exist, folks. Let's not bankrupt America chasing windmills. \ud83d\ude09 #ClimateRealism",
        "Agent9: @JoeBiden Emergency? My house ain't underwater yet! More taxes and regulations is all you got. Get real, focus on jobs and the border. #NoClimateScam"
