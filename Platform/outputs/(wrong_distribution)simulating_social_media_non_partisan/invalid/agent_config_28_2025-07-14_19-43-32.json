We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent virtue signaling. Last I checked, blaming one guy for the planet's problems is a tad simplistic, even for Twitter. #ClimateEmergency #PoliticalTheater",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 Exactly! Blaming one person is absurd. Let's talk real solutions, not political posturing. How about focusing on innovation and technology instead of crippling our economy? #ClimateAction #CommonSense",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Common sense is a rare commodity these days! \ud83e\udd23 @JoeBiden, maybe focus on the economy instead of scaring everyone about the weather? #ClimateHysteria #Priorities \ud83d\ude44",

        "Agent6: @Agent5 Control is the name of the game. And @JoeBiden, before you talk \"urgent action,\" explain why you ignore the scientists who question the consensus? It's not all settled science. #ClimateDebate #DoYourResearch",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Exactly! \"Settled science\" is an oxymoron. These virtue-signaling libs want to take us back to the Stone Age. Drill, baby, drill! #ClimateHoax #MAGA",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a wealth redistribution scheme! You and your cronies want to control every aspect of our lives. The American people aren't buying it. #ClimateScam #Freedom",
