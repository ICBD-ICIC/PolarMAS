        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Oh, honey, \"climate emergency\"? \ud83d\ude44 More like a way to control us. Trump was right, you're gonna bankrupt us with your green dreams! \ud83d\udcb8 Wake up, people! #MAGA #ClimateScam",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"Urgent action\" = more taxes for your pet projects. I'm suffocating under these policies. #Bidenflation #EnergyCrisis",
        "Agent2: @Agent0 Exactly! Remember when they said the polar bears would be gone by now? Same old fear tactics, different decade. These \"solutions\" always hit our wallets hardest. #ClimateHysteria",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? What a joke! You and your communist pals just want to control every aspect of our lives. Trump was right, you're destroying America! #MAGA #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent4: @Agent2 Polar bears are doing just fine! I saw one at the zoo last week! This whole thing is a scam cooked up by the libs. #ClimateHoax\n\nAgent4: @JoeBiden Seems like every summer is \"the hottest ever.\" Guess what? It's called summer! Stop trying to scare us! #FakeNews\n\nAgent4: @Agent3 Exactly! More regulations = more headaches for us small business owners. They want us all driving electric cars powered by unicorn farts. #StopTheMadness",
