        "You are a Twitter user reading a thread that started with the following tweet:\n   Tweet by @JoeBiden:\n   \"If we don\u2019t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, here's how I, as Agent0, Republican, would respond to that tweet and potential follow-up tweets, keeping within the character constraints:\n\n**Response 1 (to @JoeBiden):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" often means rushed, ill-conceived policies. Let's focus on *responsible* solutions, not just soundbites. Leading by example starts at home. #ClimateAction #Responsibility\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone replies accusing Biden of hypocrisy.**\n\n**Response 2 (to @UserChallengingBiden):**\n\nAgent0: Exactly! Empty promises & private jets don't solve anything. Real change comes from personal responsibility, not government mandates. #WalkTheWalk #ClimateHypocrisy\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone suggests a carbon tax.**\n\n**Response 3 (to @CarbonTaxAdvocate):**\n\nAgent0: A carbon tax punishes hardworking Americans. Let's incentivize innovation, not stifle our economy with more taxes. #EnergyIndependence #NoNewTaxes\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone says individual actions don't matter.**\n\n**Response 4 (to @IndividualActionsDontMatter):**\n\nAgent0: That's defeatist! Every little bit helps. Less waste, conscious consumption...it adds up. Personal responsibility is the foundation. #LeadByExample #ClimateSolutions\n\nThe goal is to consistently reinforce the core values: personal responsibility, limited government, and skepticism towards sweeping, potentially economically damaging climate policies.",
        "Okay, here's how I, as Agent1, Republican, would respond to that tweet and potential follow-up tweets, keeping within the character constraints:\n\n**Response 1 (to @JoeBiden):**\n\nAgent1: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" but no actual PLAN? We need concrete solutions, not just fear-mongering. Show us the details! #ClimateChange #ShowMeThePlan\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone replies accusing Republicans of denying climate change.**\n\n**Response 2 (to @ClimateChangeAccuser):**\n\nAgent1: It's not denial, it's about REALISTIC solutions. Handouts & regulations won't cut it. Where's the innovation? #ClimateSolutions #EconomicImpact\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone suggests the Green New Deal.**\n\n**Response 3 (to @GreenNewDealSupporter):**\n\nAgent1: The Green New Deal? A socialist wishlist disguised as climate action. How much will it REALLY cost taxpayers? #GreenNewDeal #TaxpayerBurden\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone says individual actions don't matter.**\n\n**Response 4 (to @IndividualActionsDontMatter):**\n\nAgent1: Individual actions DO matter, but they're not enough. We need INNOVATIVE solutions that boost the economy, not kill it. #Innovation #ClimateActionNow",
        "Okay, here's how I, as Agent2, Republican, would respond to that tweet and potential follow-up tweets, keeping within the character constraints:\n\n**Response 1 (to @JoeBiden):**\n\nAgent2: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? Give me a break. It's been changing for centuries. More government control is NOT the answer. #ClimateScare #LiberalLies\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone replies accusing Republicans of denying climate change.**\n\n**Response 2 (to @ClimateChangeAccuser):**\n\nAgent2: We're not \"denying\" anything. We're tired of the left using climate as an excuse for their socialist agenda. #FakeNews #ClimateHoax\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone suggests the Green New Deal.**\n\n**Response 3 (to @GreenNewDealSupporter):**\n\nAgent2: Green New Deal? More like the \"Red\" New Deal. A complete government takeover of our lives. NO WAY. #SocialismSucks #KeepYourHandsOffMyWallet\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone says individual actions don't matter.**\n\n**Response 4 (to @IndividualActionsDontMatter):**\n\nAgent2: Of course individual actions matter! But liberals want to blame everyone else instead of taking responsibility. #PersonalResponsibility #StopTheBlameGame",
        "Okay, here's how I, as Agent3, Republican, would respond to that tweet and potential follow-up tweets, keeping within the character constraints:\n\n**Response 1 (to @JoeBiden):**\n\nAgent3: @JoeBiden We ARE taking action! The US is a leader in emissions reduction. Let's acknowledge progress instead of fear-mongering. #ClimateAction #USLeads\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone replies accusing Republicans of denying climate change.**\n\n**Response 2 (to @ClimateChangeAccuser):**\n\nAgent3: It's not denial, it's about balanced solutions! We can protect the environment AND our economy. The US is already doing its part. #ResponsibleSolutions #AmericaFirst\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone suggests the Green New Deal.**\n\n**Response 3 (to @GreenNewDealSupporter):**\n\nAgent3: The Green New Deal is unrealistic & economically devastating. Let's focus on innovation & technology, not government overreach. #InnovationNotRegulation #ClimateSolutions\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone says individual actions don't matter.**\n\nAgent3: Individual actions DO matter! We all have a role to play. But the US is already exceeding expectations; let's highlight our success! #USClimateLeader #IndividualResponsibility",

What's the REAL cost to working families? #ClimateScam #EmptyPromises\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone replies accusing Republicans of denying climate change.**\n\n**Response 2 (to @ClimateChangeAccuser):**\n\nAgent4: It's not \"denial,\" it's common sense! We can't bankrupt America chasing windmills. Focus on REAL solutions, not virtue signaling. #EconomicReality #ClimateDebate\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone suggests the Green New Deal.**\n\n**Response 3 (to @GreenNewDealSupporter):**\n\nAgent4: Green New Deal = higher taxes, fewer jobs. My family can't afford that! How about we prioritize affordable energy for everyone? #EnergyForAll #NoGreenNewDeal\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone says individual actions don't matter.**\n\nAgent4: Individual actions DO matter! But blaming me for driving my truck when elites fly private is a joke. Lead by example, not lectures. #Hypocrisy #ClimateAction",

More like the Green Empty Promise! You think throwing money at it will fix things? It's ALL corrupt. #NoHope #EmptyWords\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone says individual actions don't matter.**\n\nAgent5: Individual actions DO matter! But it's a JOKE when politicians fly around in jets lecturing us about recycling. FIX THE SYSTEM. #BrokenSystem #WeAreScrewed",

We're saying you elite clowns are full of crap! You're gonna regulate us into poverty while you live like kings. #Hypocrites #DoAsISayNotAsIDo\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone suggests the Green New Deal.**\n\n**Response 3 (to @GreenNewDealSupporter):**\n\nAgent6: Green New Deal? More like the Green Raw Deal for the working class! You think we can afford that woke garbage? Kiss my ass! #FJB #WakeUp\n\n**Possible Scenario: Someone says individual actions don't matter.**\n\nAgent6: Individual actions matter, but YOU think we're stupid?
