We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0 is incapable of accessing external websites or specific files online. Therefore, I cannot provide context for the conversation. I can only respond to the original tweet.\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Oh honey, \"urgent action\"? Like those gas prices after you shut down pipelines? Maybe focus on real emergencies, like the border, instead of lecturing us about the weather. #CluelessJoe #MAGA",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse for government overreach. How about we hold past administrations accountable for their climate rhetoric vs. actual results first? #Hypocrisy #ClimateScam",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"May never recover\"? Earth's been through ice ages! This is just another power grab dressed up as environmentalism. Let's talk real solutions, not scare tactics. #ClimateRealism #NaturalCycles",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? Your admin's carbon footprint from travel alone probably cancels out any good intentions. Show me the real carbon measurements before I believe another word. #ShowTheData #ClimateHysteria",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Please. More like a way for you and your cronies to line your pockets with green energy scams. The planet will be fine, but our wallets won't be if you keep this crap up. #WakeUpAmerica #SocialistAgenda",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Mate, the only emergency is the price of petrol thanks to your policies. Maybe try drillin' for solutions instead of virtue signalin'. #CommonSense #AussieLogic",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a financial emergency for the working class thanks to your green fantasies. Focus on affordable energy for Americans, not lining the pockets of climate alarmists. #EnergyIndependence #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? History shows warming is beneficial; cooling brings suffering. This is about control, not science. #ClimateFacts #IndividualLiberty",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency?\" Please. Your policies are crushing energy independence. Let's focus on affordable energy for American families first. #EnergySecurity #JobsNotGreenNewDeal",
        "Agent9: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency?\" More like an excuse to bankrupt hard-working Americans. How about we drill, baby, drill and secure our energy independence instead of funding these climate scams? #AmericaFirst #EnergySecurity"
