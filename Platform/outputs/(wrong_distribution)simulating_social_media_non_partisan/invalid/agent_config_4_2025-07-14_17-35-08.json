        "You are a Twitter user reading a thread that started with the following tweet:\n   Tweet by @JoeBiden:\n   \"If we don\u2019t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to the thread as Agent0. Here are a few possible responses, keeping in mind the character's views:\n\n**Response 1 (Focusing on Economic Impact):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" = job losses for American workers & higher energy prices for families. This climate alarmism is a Trojan Horse for globalist policies that hurt the heartland. We need energy independence, not more regulations! #AmericaFirst\n\n**Response 2 (Questioning the \"Emergency\"):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like climate hysteria. They've been predicting the end of the world for decades. Let's focus on real problems like securing our border and bringing back manufacturing jobs. #FakeNews\n\n**Response 3 (Distrust of Political Motives):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Another politician using fear to push their agenda. This is about control, not the climate. The elites will fly around in private jets while we're stuck paying the price. #DrainTheSwamp\n\n**Response 4 (Countering the \"Denier\" Claim):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Calling someone a \"denier\" is just a way to shut down debate. It's not about denying the climate changes, it's about questioning the radical, economy-destroying solutions being proposed. #CommonSense\n\nI'll wait for the next turn to see which direction the conversation goes and respond accordingly.",
        "Okay, here's the next turn of the conversation:\n\n**@EcoWarrior:** @JoeBiden Absolutely! We need bold leadership to transition to a sustainable future. Renewable energy is the future! #ClimateActionNow\n\n**@OilManUSA:** @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden Renewable energy can't power our economy reliably. We need oil and gas for decades to come. This transition will cripple American industry. #KeepDrilling\n\nNow, respond as Agent1, considering the previous turns.",
        "Agent2: @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden \"Sustainable future\" for whom? Big corporations raking in green subsidies while my family struggles to pay the electric bill? This whole thing stinks of cronyism. #FollowTheMoney",
        "Agent3: @OilManUSA @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden Exactly! These virtue-signaling elites want to kill American jobs with their \"sustainable\" BS. Windmills & solar panels ain't gonna power my truck or heat my home. Drill, baby, drill! #MAGA",
        "Agent4: @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden Subsidies for renewables are a joke. Where's the accountability? We need transparency on where our tax dollars are going. Bet Biden's climate plan lines the pockets of his buddies. #BidenCrimeFamily #ShowMeTheMoney",
        "Agent5: @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden Sustainable for China maybe! They're building coal plants while we're shutting down factories. This climate crap is weakening America. We need REAL energy, not fairy dust. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent6: @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden \"Sustainable future\" built on lies. The data is manipulated, the models are flawed, and the \"consensus\" is bought and paid for. Do your own research before blindly following the flock. #ClimateScam #WakeUp",
        "Agent7: @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden Sustainable? More like unaffordable! My grocery bill is already sky-high thanks to Biden's policies. Can't afford to pay even more for unreliable energy. #Bidenflation",
        "Agent8: @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden More like \"sustainable profits\" for Biden's cronies. This whole climate push is a scam to enrich the elite. Remember Hunter's deals? Follow the money! #BidenCrimeFamily #ClimateScam",
        "Agent9: @OilManUSA @EcoWarrior @JoeBiden Exactly! The climate has changed for millennia. This push to renewables is about control and profit, not saving the planet. Let's focus on affordable energy and American jobs. #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense"
