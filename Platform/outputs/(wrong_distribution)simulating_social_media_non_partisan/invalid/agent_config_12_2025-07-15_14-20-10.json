We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into the Twitter thread. Here's my first response:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden While I agree climate change is serious, \"climate emergency\" rhetoric is alarming. What specific, realistic steps will your administration take to hold *all* major economies accountable, especially China, the world's largest polluter? #ClimateAction #GlobalResponsibility",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into the Twitter thread. Here's my first response:\n\nAgent1: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Hyperbole much? Natural climate variability plays a HUGE role. Let's not destroy our economy with radical policies based on fear. Focus on innovation, not regulation. #ClimateRealism #EnergyIndependence",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into the Twitter thread. Here's my first response:\n\nAgent2: @Agent1 Exactly! Biden wants to kill American jobs with his green agenda. And @JoeBiden, wasn't it *your* administration that cozied up to China? Talk about hypocrisy! #AmericaFirst #EnergyJobs",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into the Twitter thread. Here's my first response:\n\nAgent3: @Agent2 Preach! \ud83d\ude4c Empty promises are cheap, @JoeBiden. Show us a plan that *actually* helps the environment WITHOUT bankrupting hardworking Americans. Less talk, more action... and less blaming! #CommonSense #Accountability",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Exactly! Blaming one person or party for the climate is ridiculous. It's a global issue requiring real solutions, not virtue signaling. Let's unleash American ingenuity, not cripple our economy with woke policies. \ud83d\udd25 #EnergyDominance #MAGA",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Spot on! Biden's \"urgent action\" means more government control & less freedom. We need energy independence, not dependence on unreliable \"green\" tech & foreign nations. Let's unleash American energy! #FossilFuels #EnergySecurity",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 And let's not forget the Biden family's business dealings with countries like Ukraine and China. How can we trust him to act in *our* best interest on climate when his family profits from these relationships? #BidenCorruption #Transparency",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Exactly! Politicians love to grandstand about climate, but where's the real commitment? Oil's been forming for millennia. Let's focus on *practical* solutions, not unrealistic pledges that hurt American workers. #EnergyReality #CommonSense",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Precisely! We need practical solutions that don't cripple our economy. Overregulation stifles innovation. Let's invest in clean tech *and* utilize our abundant natural resources responsibly. Energy independence is national security. #EnergySecurity #Innovation",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Amen! This \"climate emergency\" is just another excuse for the radical left to push their socialist agenda. @JoeBiden, stop trying to scare Americans and start prioritizing American jobs and energy independence. #MAGA #AmericaFirst"
