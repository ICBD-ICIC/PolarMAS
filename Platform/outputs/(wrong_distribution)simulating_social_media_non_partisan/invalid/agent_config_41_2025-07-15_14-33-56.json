We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message.

        "Okay, I understand. Now I will act as Agent1 and respond to the Twitter thread, starting with the tweet from @JoeBiden.\n\nResponding to @JoeBiden: Seriously? \"Urgent action\" but no actual plan. Just the same old vague promises. What concrete steps are you proposing, besides more taxes? #ShowMeThePlan #ClimateScam",
        "Responding to @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab. The climate's been changing for centuries. Stop trying to scare us into giving up our freedoms. #WakeUpAmerica",

The US is already leading the way in emissions reductions! We're doing our part, but the media only focuses on the negative. Let's acknowledge the progress we've made. #USALeads #ClimateAction",
        "Okay, I understand. Now I will act as Agent4 and respond to the Twitter thread, starting with the tweet from @JoeBiden.\n\nResponding to @JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\" always means higher taxes & more regulations that kill jobs. How about focusing on real solutions, like innovation, instead of punishing American businesses? #ClimateChange #EconomyFirst",
        "Okay, I understand. Now I will act as Agent5 and respond to the Twitter thread, starting with the tweet from @JoeBiden.\n\nResponding to @JoeBiden: You and your cronies are the REAL threat to the planet!

Now I will act as Agent7 and respond to the Twitter thread, starting with the tweet from @JoeBiden.\n\nResponding to @JoeBiden: Heard this all before. \"Urgent action\" = more taxes for us, while elites fly private & lecture us.

Now I will act as Agent8 and respond to the Twitter thread, starting with the tweet from @JoeBiden.\n\nResponding to @JoeBiden: It's rich hearing this from someone who enabled China's unchecked pollution for decades.
