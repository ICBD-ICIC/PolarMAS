        "You are a Twitter user reading a thread that started with the following tweet:\n   Tweet by @JoeBiden:\n   \"If we don\u2019t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, here's how I'd respond to that Twitter thread, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Recover\"? The planet will be here. It's *us* who won't. Empty promises won't cut it. We need real action, not just words. #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate\n\n**Tweet 2 (assuming someone replied negatively to Biden):**\n\nTo the naysayers: It's not just about polar bears. It's about our children's future and a moral obligation to protect God's creation. #ClimateAction #ForTheFuture\n\n**Tweet 3 (if the conversation is about cost):**\n\nThe cost of inaction is far greater. What's the price of clean air & water? We can't put a dollar amount on a livable planet. #ClimateChangeIsReal #CleanEnergyNow",
        "Okay, I understand. Here's how I, as Agent1, would respond to that Twitter thread, staying under 280 characters and introducing new angles:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\" looks a lot like crippling our energy independence. Let's focus on innovation, not regulation. American ingenuity can solve this without sacrificing our economy. #ClimateChange #EnergyIndependence\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone mentioned renewable energy):**\n\nWindmills and solar panels aren't the whole answer. We need a diverse energy portfolio, including natural gas and nuclear, to maintain reliability and affordability. #EnergySecurity #AllOfTheAbove\n\n**Tweet 3 (if the conversation is about international cooperation):**\n\nBefore we hamstring our own economy, let's see China and India make real commitments. We shouldn't be the only ones paying the price. #AmericaFirst #ClimateRealism",
        "Okay, here's how I'd respond to that Twitter thread, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n@JoeBiden: Climate emergency? More like a socialist power grab! You and your cronies want to control every aspect of our lives. Leave us alone! #MAGA #Bidenflation\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone defends Biden's plan):**\nOh, so you think higher taxes and more regulations are the answer? Wake up! It's destroying our economy and lining the pockets of your Green New Deal buddies. #WakeUpAmerica #DrainTheSwamp\n\n**Tweet 3 (if someone brings up scientific consensus):**\n\"Scientific consensus\"? That's a joke! It's all manipulated to push a liberal agenda. I trust my gut and common sense, not some so-called expert. #FakeNews #DeepState",
        "Okay, I understand. Here's how I, as Agent3, would respond to that Twitter thread, staying under 280 characters and introducing new angles:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n\n@JoeBiden: A \"climate emergency\"? Really? How about the emergency at our southern border? Or the inflation crushing families? Focus on real problems, not woke fantasies. #Priorities #BidenFail\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone mentions renewable energy):**\n\nRenewables are great... when the sun shines and the wind blows. They're unreliable and expensive. We need affordable energy to keep our economy strong. #EnergyReality #CommonSense\n\n**Tweet 3 (if the conversation is about international cooperation):**\n\nWe're lectured about climate while China builds coal plants at record speed? Please. Let's hold them accountable first. #Hypocrisy #AmericaFirst",
        "Okay, here's how I'd respond to that Twitter thread, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? You mean the one they've been predicting for 50 years? Spare me the Chicken Little routine. How about fixing the border first? #ClimateScam #Priorities\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone defends Biden's plan):**\n\nMore taxes and regulations? That's your solution to everything! How about we let the free market innovate instead of bankrupting the country? #FreeMarket #CommonSense\n\n**Tweet 3 (if someone brings up scientific consensus):**\n\n\"97% of scientists agree\"? Yeah, and 97% of politicians are full of it. Do your own research and think for yourself! #QuestionEverything #ClimateHoax",
        "Okay, I understand. Here's how I'd respond to that Twitter thread, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n\n@JoeBiden: China's laughing all the way to the bank while we're busy crippling our own energy sector. They're dominating the renewable energy market. We need to compete, not surrender. #China #EnergyIndependence\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone defends Biden's plan):**\n\nSubsidies and mandates won't make us competitive. We need to unleash American innovation and cut the red tape holding us back. Let's lead the world in *real* clean energy solutions. #Innovation #AmericanEnergy\n\n**Tweet 3 (if someone brings up scientific consensus):**\n\nThe science is important, but so is our economy. We can't sacrifice jobs and prosperity on the altar of climate alarmism. Let's find a balanced approach. #EnergySecurity #CommonSense",
        "Okay, those responses are good. Here's how I, as Agent6, would respond to that Twitter thread, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? I'm seeing more extreme weather patterns, that's for sure. But are we really addressing the root causes or just throwing money at the problem? Show me the data, not just the rhetoric. #ClimateAction #ShowMeTheData\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone defends Biden's plan involving government spending):**\n\nAll that spending... where's it *actually* going? Are we funding projects that work, or just lining the pockets of special interests? We need accountability, not just blank checks. #Accountability #ClimateSpending\n\n**Tweet 3 (if someone brings up scientific consensus):**\n\n\"Consensus\" doesn't equal truth. Remember when they said cigarettes were safe? Let's focus on verifiable data and real-world solutions, not just blindly following the crowd. #CriticalThinking #ClimateDebate",
        "Okay, those responses are good. Here's how I, as Agent7, would respond to that Twitter thread, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n\n@JoeBiden: Climate \"emergency\"? You and Warren are richer than Croesus pushing this garbage. Hypocrites! While you fly around in private jets, real Americans can't afford gas! #ClimateScam #Bidenflation\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone defends Biden's plan):**\n\nOh, so raising taxes and killing jobs is \"saving the planet\"? More like destroying the American Dream! You're delusional if you think this will work. #WakeUpAmerica #SocialistAgenda\n\n**Tweet 3 (if someone mentions scientific consensus):**\n\n\"The science is settled\"? Says who? You and your liberal buddies? I trust my own eyes, and I see a bunch of BS. This is about control, not the climate. #DeepState #FakeNews",
        "Okay, those responses are good. Here's how I, as Agent8, would respond to that Twitter thread, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n\n@JoeBiden: Climate emergency? Try the border emergency, the inflation emergency, or the woke ideology emergency. Focus on what's destroying America NOW. #Priorities #BidenIsAFailure\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone defends Biden's plan):**\n\nYour \"solutions\" are killing jobs and raising prices. We need energy independence, not Green New Deal fantasies. Drill, baby, drill! #EnergySecurity #MAGA\n\n**Tweet 3 (if someone mentions scientific consensus):**\n\n\"Science\" is just another political tool for you liberals. Common sense tells me your policies are disastrous. #FakeNews #DoYourOwnResearch",

You just want to control us! Focus on the border and stop the woke agenda! #MAGA #BidenIsAFailure\n\n**Tweet 2 (if someone defends Biden's plan):**\n\nMore regulations and higher taxes? That's your answer to everything! You're destroying our economy! #Bidenflation #WakeUpAmerica\n\n**Tweet 3 (if someone mentions scientific consensus):**\n\n\"Scientific consensus\"? It's all lies!
