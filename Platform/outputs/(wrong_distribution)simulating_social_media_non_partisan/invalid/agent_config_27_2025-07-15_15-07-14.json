Secure the border and fix the economy first! #AmericaFirst\n\nAgent2: The \"climate emergency\" narrative is being used to justify radical policies that will hurt working families. Energy independence is the answer, not more regulations. #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden The \"climate emergency\" is a joke. Your policies are destroying American energy independence & hurting hardworking families. Focus on real issues, like the border crisis & inflation YOU caused. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",

        "Agent9: @JoeBiden More taxes for your climate fantasy? How about you fix the border YOU opened and stop the inflation YOU caused first? #AmericaFirst #Bidenflation"
