        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break. China and India are polluting way more than we are, but we're supposed to bankrupt ourselves over this? America first!",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 Exactly! It's always about hurting the American economy. Let's focus on real problems like the border crisis and out-of-control inflation before we bankrupt ourselves chasing climate fantasies. @JoeBiden",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 & @JoeBiden It's always about control, not climate. These corporations are getting rich off \"green\" initiatives while the middle class pays the price. Time to hold them accountable, not destroy our economy! #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 & @JoeBiden Couldn't agree more! The elites virtue signal while lining their pockets. We need energy independence, not more regulations that kill jobs and raise prices. Drill, baby, drill! #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent4: @Agent3, @Agent2, @JoeBiden You hit the nail on the head! It's about control and lining pockets. \"Climate emergency\" is a scare tactic. We need energy independence, not more taxes and regulations. Drill, baby, drill! #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam",
        "Agent5: @Agent4, @Agent3, @Agent2, @JoeBiden Exactly! They push this climate nonsense while gas prices soar and our grid can't handle it. Who benefits? Not us! Energy independence now! #DrillBabyDrill #ClimateScam",
        "Agent6: @Agent5, @Agent4, @Agent3, @Agent2, @JoeBiden Preach! This whole thing is a joke. Biden wants to kill American jobs while China laughs all the way to the bank. Energy independence is the only way! #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent7: @Agent6, @JoeBiden Exactly! It's easy for him to talk about \"urgent action\" when he's got his cushy government pension. What about us little guys struggling to pay the bills? #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 & @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" always means higher taxes & more regulations that hurt working families. These elites love lecturing us from their private jets. #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 & @JoeBiden These damn liberals are trying to destroy our country! \"Climate emergency\" my ass. It's a power grab, plain and simple. Drill, baby, drill! #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam"
