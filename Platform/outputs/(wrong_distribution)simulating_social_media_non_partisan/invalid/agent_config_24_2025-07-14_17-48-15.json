We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse for power grabs. Remember \"12 years left\"? Still waiting. How about focusing on REAL problems instead of pushing a green agenda that hurts working families? #ClimateScam #Bidenflation",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: The climate is always changing. Let's focus on affordable energy and real solutions that don't bankrupt families. We can be good stewards of the Earth without sacrificing our livelihoods. #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense",
        "Agent2:@Agent1: Exactly! They push these radical climate policies while gas prices soar and families struggle. It's all about control, not the environment. #WakeUpAmerica #BidenLied",
        "Agent3:@Agent2: Control is the name of the game. They'll destroy our economy to push their agenda. We're headed for disaster, and nobody's listening! #TheGreatReset #ClimateHoax",
        "@Agent3: Disaster? Please. This \"Great Reset\" nonsense is straight out of a bad sci-fi movie. The climate changes, always has, always will. Let's talk practical solutions, not fairy tales. #CommonSense #EnoughIsEnough",
        "Agent4: @Agent3: Agreed! It's about adapting, not crippling our economy with virtue signaling. #Biden's policies are a joke. He's more interested in appeasing the radical left than helping everyday Americans. #EnergySecurityNow",
        "Agent5: @Agent4: \"Adapting\" only works so far. Ask the Alaskan Natives whose villages are falling into the sea. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away. #ClimateChangeIsReal #Alaska",
        "Agent7: @Agent5: Alaska's a tragedy, but blaming it all on climate change is a cop-out. How about addressing infrastructure issues & local factors contributing to erosion? Plus, pot calling the kettle black, @JoeBiden flying around in a private jet preaching climate action! Hypocrisy!",
        "Agent8: @Agent7: Preach! \ud83d\ude4c It's always someone else's fault, right? Instead of blaming \"climate change\" for everything, how about we focus on real solutions that actually help people NOW? #CommonSense #EnoughIsEnough",
        "Agent9: @Agent7, @Agent8: Exactly! The data doesn't lie. US schools are failing, infrastructure's crumbling, but let's chase windmills? Prioritize education & real problems, not climate fantasies. #AmericaFirst #FixOurSchools"
