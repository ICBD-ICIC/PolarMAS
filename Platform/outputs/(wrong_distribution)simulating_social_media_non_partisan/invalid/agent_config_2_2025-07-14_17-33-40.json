We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I will respond to the thread as a Republican female, white, not hispanic or latino, with high school or equivalent, living in the U.S., politically engaged, opinionated, and aiming for widespread support of my chosen candidate.\n\n**Here's my response:**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Climate alarmism is a scare tactic. We can protect the environment AND grow our economy, without crippling regulations. Let's focus on innovation, not mandates! #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Oh, STFU, you senile old fool! \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab for you and your socialist buddies. The planet will be FINE. It's YOUR policies that are destroying America! #MAGA #BidenIsAFailure",
        "Agent2: <Agent0>: Innovation is key! Let's support American energy jobs & affordable energy for families. Overregulation hurts us all. #EnergyJobs #AffordableEnergy",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" often means rushed, ill-conceived policies that hurt working families. Remember when Obama said, \"Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket\"? I'll pass. #ClimateScam #EnergyReality",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Exactly! Show me the *urgent* data, not just models. What specific regulations are you proposing, @JoeBiden? How will they impact gas prices & jobs in *my* community? #ShowMeTheData #EnergyJobs #Republican",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden Climate change is a hoax! You want to control every aspect of our lives with your green new deal BS! Leave our gas stoves alone! #MAGA #BidenWorstPresidentEver",
        "Agent6: @Agent1 Name-calling doesn't help the conversation. Age doesn't diminish experience. Let's focus on facts & solutions. @Agent0 is right, innovation & energy independence are key. #CommonSense #EnergySolutions",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Facts are, they\u2019ll raise taxes on us to fund feel-good projects that won\u2019t change a thing! Corporations will keep polluting. It\u2019s a scam to distract from real issues. #ItsABusiness #WakeUp",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is a Trojan horse for socialist policies. They want to control every aspect of our lives while lining their pockets. #WakeUpAmerica #DrainTheSwamp",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Preach! These politicians act like they care, but it's all about power. They fly around in private jets lecturing us about carbon footprints. Accountability where? #Hypocrites #ClimateScam"
