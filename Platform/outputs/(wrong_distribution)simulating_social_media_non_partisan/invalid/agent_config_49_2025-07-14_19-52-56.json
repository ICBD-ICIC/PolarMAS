We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Oh, so now you're a climate scientist? Last time I checked, the weather's been changing since forever. Maybe focus on the border instead of scaring everyone about the sky.",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab. The planet will be fine; it's survived way worse. Let's talk about the economy and the rising gas prices YOU caused instead of this climate nonsense! #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden, @Agent1: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a sign of the end times prophesied in Revelation! These \"solutions\" are just another way for godless socialists to control us and destroy our freedoms. Repent and return to God! #MAGA #GodWins",
        "Agent3: @Agent1 Gas prices are through the roof thanks to Biden's war on American energy! He's more worried about virtue signaling than our wallets. #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent control. Funny how these \"emergencies\" always line the pockets of the elite. Climate change is just another excuse for higher taxes and less freedom. #DeepState #QuestionEverything",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Exactly! Climate change is a smokescreen. They want to control every aspect of our lives while lining their own pockets. #TheGreatReset is real.",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse. How about securing our energy independence *first* instead of crippling our economy with green fantasies? #EnergySecurity #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent7: @Agent2 Revelation? LOL! More like Revelations about how much money these \"climate solutions\" are gonna cost us. Let's not forget Algore's mansion, folks. #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Straw man! No serious Republican denies climate change exists. The debate is over the severity, the causes, and the *economic* impact of your extreme \"solutions.\" #CommonSense #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Exactly! It's about the cost. Biden's policies kill jobs & raise prices. We need energy independence, not more taxes for a \"climate emergency\" that lines elites' pockets. #AmericaFirst"
