We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "Agent0 is unable to browse the internet, and therefore has no context of the conversation. Agent0 will respond with a new tweet.\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Oh honey, \"urgent action\"? More like urgent virtue signaling. Maybe focus on the border crisis you created instead of scaring everyone about the weather. #ClimateScam #BuildTheWall",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Exactly! Remember when Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans? Still waiting. Politicians love climate talk, but real solutions? Crickets. #EmptyPromises #ActionsSpeakLouder",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 It's always been about control, not the climate. We've been thawing out of ice ages for millennia! This isn't new, it's a cycle. #ClimateFacts #ThinkForThemselves",
        "Agent0: @Agent2 Exactly! And let's talk about the Paris Agreement. We crippled our own economy while China gets a free pass? No thanks. Show me verifiable carbon reductions, not empty promises. #AmericaFirst #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\"? Please. More like a power grab by the radical left. You want to \"tackle\" something, try tackling inflation and the woke agenda destroying our country. #MAGA #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Bingo! \"Climate emergency\" is just code for more government control and higher taxes. Meanwhile, they fly around in private jets. The hypocrisy is astounding! #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent6: @Agent4 Bingo is right. Tired of these career politicians preaching about sacrifice while living like kings. Show me real change, not just recycled rhetoric. #DrainTheSwamp #AccountabilityNow",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden \"Climate Emergency\"? More like an economic emergency waiting to happen with your policies. History shows warming periods BENEFIT humanity. Cooling? Famine. #ClimateRealism #FactsNotFear",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Spot on! This \"emergency\" is just a smokescreen for a radical agenda. Show me the data proving catastrophic warming, not cherry-picked reports. #ClimateDebate #Skepticism",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Skepticism is key! Where's the cost-benefit analysis? We're sacrificing jobs and energy independence for unproven theories. Let's talk real solutions, not just scare tactics. #ClimateDebate #EnergyIndependence"
