We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "Okay, I'm ready. Let's see what Biden's saying now.\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? Please. More taxes and regulations that hurt working families. And \"climate change denier\"? Seriously? It's called being skeptical of your ridiculous claims. #CommonSense #EnoughIsEnough",
