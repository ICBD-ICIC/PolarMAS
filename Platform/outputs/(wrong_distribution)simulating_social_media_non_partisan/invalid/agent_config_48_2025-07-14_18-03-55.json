We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I will respond to the tweet thread as a Republican woman with a high school education, deeply concerned about the direction of the country.\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" means higher taxes & job-killing regulations that hurt working families NOW. The climate has ALWAYS changed. Let's focus on REAL problems, like the border crisis & inflation, before bankrupting America with this climate nonsense.",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Oh, NOW you care about \"urgent action\"? Where was this urgency when Native lands were being bulldozed for pipelines under Obama/Biden? Hypocrites! #ClimateScam #EmptyPromises",
        "Agent0: Seriously! @JoeBiden Where was the \"urgent action\" when gas prices were reasonable? This whole climate thing feels like a power grab disguised as saving the world. #Bidenflation",
        "Agent3: @Agent0 Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just an excuse to control us. I'm more worried about affording groceries than some imaginary crisis. #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden @Agent0 \"Climate emergency\"? More like a wealth transfer scheme. We need affordable energy, not virtue signaling that destroys jobs! #DrillBabyDrill #BidenLies",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden So, after 47 years in DC, NOW you're the climate savior? What concrete actions did you take as VP besides pushing failed green energy boondoggles like Solyndra? #Accountability #EmptyWords",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden @Agent4 Drill, baby, drill! This ain't about the planet, it's about control. Biden's climate agenda will leave us relying on enemies for energy. Remember Venezuela? #EnergyIndependence #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden Hyperbole much? The planet will be fine. It's our economy I'm worried about. This \"climate emergency\" will cost jobs & raise prices. Fix the border, lower inflation - THEN talk about saving the world. #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden @Agent7 \"May never recover\"? Dramatic much? More like \"may never recover from Biden's policies\"! Focus on real issues like inflation & securing the border. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent9: @JoeBiden More taxes to \"save\" us? Been there, done that. How about securing the border & fixing inflation FIRST? This climate obsession is gonna bankrupt us all! #Priorities #CommonSense"
