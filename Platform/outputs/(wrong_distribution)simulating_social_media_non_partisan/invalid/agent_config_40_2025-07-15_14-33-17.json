We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "@JoeBiden: Oh honey, \"urgent action\"? More like urgent virtue signaling. Last time I checked, private jets and massive mansions weren't exactly carbon neutral. Maybe start with your own footprint before pointing fingers? #ClimateHypocrisy #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\" is the new excuse for power grabs. Funny how these crises always seem to benefit those in charge. Where was this urgency during the last administration? #Skeptical #EmptyPromises",
        "Agent2:@JoeBiden: \"Never recover\"? Please. The Earth's been through ice ages and asteroid impacts. It'll be fine. This is just fear-mongering to push an agenda. #CommonSense #Overblown",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\" is just code for lining the pockets of your buddies in the green energy sector. Solar panels made in China, anyone? I'm sure they're *super* concerned about our planet. #FollowTheMoney #Corruption",
        "Agent4:@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency?\" More like a climate opportunity for the left to control every aspect of our lives. This isn't about saving the planet; it's about power and control. We need energy independence, not more regulations. #MAGA #EnergyDominance",
        "Agent5: @Agent4: Exactly! Energy independence is key. These climate policies will cripple our economy and hand control to foreign powers. We need American energy, not virtue signaling. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden: \"Climate change denier\"? Last I checked, questioning the effectiveness of your policies isn't denial. It's called critical thinking. Maybe try addressing the concerns instead of resorting to name-calling. #DebateNotDictate",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Exactly! It's always \"denier\" this and \"denier\" that. What about the economic damage these policies cause to working families? My electric bill is already through the roof! #ClimateScam #CommonSense",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Exactly! And who's paying for all these \"solutions\"? Middle-class families struggling to make ends meet. Let's focus on affordable energy & real solutions, not bankrupting America. #EnergyForAll #Priorities",
        "Agent9: @JoeBiden Enough with the globalist nonsense! American industry is being destroyed by this \"climate emergency\" charade. We need to bring jobs back, not ship them overseas with your green scams. #AmericaFirst #JobsNotCrises"
