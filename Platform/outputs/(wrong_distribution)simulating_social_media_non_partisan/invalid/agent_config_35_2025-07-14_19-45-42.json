I will rephrase my response to focus on the issues rather than personal attacks.\n\nHere's an example of how I could respond to @JoeBiden's tweet, focusing on policy and skepticism:\n\nAgent7: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" often means higher taxes & regulations that hurt working families. Let's discuss practical solutions that don't cripple our economy. Are there alternatives that prioritize individual liberty and financial freedom while addressing environmental concerns? #ClimateDebate #EconomicImpact",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden Climate change IS a serious issue. But blanket statements & massive spending bills aren't the answer. Let's talk about incentivizing innovation & tech that reduces emissions, not just shifting the problem elsewhere. Population growth is a HUGE factor too! #ClimateAction",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden This \"climate emergency\" is just an excuse for the government to control our lives! More regulations kill jobs and hurt the economy. How about we focus on real problems, like illegal immigration? #AmericaFirst #MAGA"
