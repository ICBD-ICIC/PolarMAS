        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab! Our planet has been changing for millennia. Stop trying to scare us into giving up our freedoms and our gas cars! #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Oh, shove it, Joe! \"Climate emergency\"? More like an excuse to raise taxes and control our lives! You think we're stupid enough to fall for this crap? #WakeUpAmerica #NoMoreLies",
        "Agent2: @Agent0 @Agent1 @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a \"Taxpayer's Wallet Emergency\"! \ud83d\ude02 Biden's gonna \"tackle\" our wallets, alright. #ClimateAlarmists #RedWaveComing",
