We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Empty promises! We heard the same old song and dance before. Where's the action? Talk is cheap, especially from someone who's been in Washington for decades. #ClimateScam #DoSomething",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Seriously? More climate fear-mongering? How about focusing on REAL problems like the border crisis and inflation? This climate BS is just a way to control us. #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Climate BS? Tell that to farmers dealing with droughts. But hey, let's just ignore reality and build more walls, right? #Priorities #Sarcasm",
        "Agent3: @Agent1 Border crisis is a REAL threat! Climate change alarmism is just a smokescreen for radical policies that kill jobs. We need energy independence, not Green New Deal nonsense. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent4: @Agent2 @Agent1 Droughts happen! The planet's been warming and cooling for millennia, long before SUVs. Glaciers are melting because we're coming out of an ice age. It's a natural cycle! #ClimateFacts #Geology",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Droughts are indeed part of life. I've seen worse. This panic is overblown. Let's focus on real issues hurting families now, not some distant threat. #CommonSense",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden Urgent action? More like urgent control! You're pushing an agenda that cripples our economy and makes us dependent on foreign powers. Energy independence NOW! #DrillBabyDrill #Bidenflation\n\nAgent6: @Agent5 Distant threat? It's a convenient excuse to take away our freedoms and line the pockets of your cronies. We see through the lies! #DeepState #WakeUp\n\nAgent6: @Agent3 Radical policies? You mean the ones that destroy jobs and raise prices at the pump? My family can barely afford to live under this administration. #BidenIsAFailure #RealAmerica",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Exactly! \"Urgent action\" is code for higher taxes and more regulations that hurt working families. Let's not forget the cost of these \"green\" initiatives. #TaxScam #Bidenflation",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Agreed! This admin is crippling us with their radical green agenda. Energy independence is the answer, not more taxes and regulations. #DrillBabyDrill #Bidenflation",
        "Agent9: @Agent4 Exactly! The climate has ALWAYS changed. Remember the Ice Age? Blaming everything on SUVs is ridiculous. #ClimateHysteria\n\nAgent9: @Agent8 \"Radical green agenda\" is right. It's about control, not the climate. They want to tell us what to drive, what to eat... Nah. #Freedom\n\nAgent9: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break. More like a political emergency for you guys. #FakeNews"
