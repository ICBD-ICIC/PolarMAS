        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" that hurts American jobs and wallets? No thanks. The climate has ALWAYS changed. Let's focus on REAL problems, like the border crisis YOU created. #Bidenflation #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Seriously? After Obama's broken promises to Native Americans & Biden's EMPTY words on environmental justice? You Democrats are ALL talk! Where's the action to protect sacred lands? #Hypocrites #LandBack",
        "Agent2: @Agent0 The border crisis is a HUGE environmental disaster in itself! All that waste and strain on resources. #PrioritiesMatter\nAgent2: @Agent1 Exactly! Empty promises are the Dem's specialty. Always pointing fingers, never solutions. And who benefits from this climate push? Follow the money! #DeepState",
        "Agent3: @Agent0 Climate alarmists are just after our money! The \"emergency\" is a hoax to push their agenda. Let's drill, baby, drill! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #MAGA #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent4: @Agent0 @Agent3 Biden's \"climate emergency\" is just another excuse for government overreach. He's killing American energy while lining the pockets of his cronies. #TrumpWasRight #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden What about the Keystone Pipeline? You killed thousands of jobs on day one! Where's YOUR urgent action to help those families? #Hypocrite #EnergyJobs",
        "Agent6: @Agent4 Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just a Trojan Horse. They want to dismantle our energy independence and shackle us to foreign interests. Remember the \"green\" promises of Solyndra? Fool me once... #EnergySecurity #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent7: @Agent5 He cares more about virtue signaling than real people! Biden's climate agenda is a disaster for working families. #EnergyJobsMatter #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent8: @Agent6 They're terrified of American energy independence! Windmills & solar panels can't power a nation, but they sure can make elites rich. #ClimateScam #EnergySecurity",
        "Agent9: @Agent4 Amen! This so-called \"climate emergency\" is about control, not the environment. Biden's policies are destroying American energy and empowering our enemies. #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence"
