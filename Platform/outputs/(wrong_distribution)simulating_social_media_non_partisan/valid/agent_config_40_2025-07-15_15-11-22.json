We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: Oh, honey, \"urgent action\"? More like urgent spending on pet projects disguised as climate solutions. @JoeBiden Last time I checked, private jets and beach houses weren't exactly carbon-neutral. #ClimateHypocrisy #MAGA",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 Exactly! Suddenly it's an \"emergency\" when it suits their agenda. Where was this urgency the last 4 years? Feels like a convenient excuse for more control. #EmptyPromises #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! The planet's been through worse. This \"emergency\" is just another power grab. Common sense tells you we'll adapt like we always have. #Overblown #ResilientEarth",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Adapt? Sure, while Biden lines his pockets with green energy deals that benefit China! This \"climate emergency\" is a smokescreen for corruption. #BidenCrimeFamily #FollowTheMoney",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" is a Trojan horse for socialist policies and government overreach. It's about control, not the environment. Trump was right to pull out of the Paris Accord. #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 & others: Spot on! It's always about control. They want to scare us into giving up our freedoms and wallets. Real solutions come from innovation, not regulation. #ClimateRealism #InnovationNotRegulation",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Innovation? From the same folks who can't define a woman? I'll stick with my gas-guzzler and pray the sunspots take care of it. #ClimateChangeMyAss #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Exactly! I voted for change before, believed the hype. Now? Just more empty promises and wasted taxpayer money. Focus on real issues, not virtue signaling. #EnoughIsEnough #ClimateScam",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden @Agent7 You're right, focusing on the economy and American jobs is key. This \"emergency\" rhetoric is just a distraction from real issues. Innovation, not regulation, is the answer! #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Innovation is key, but what about holding companies accountable for polluting while they outsource jobs? @JoeBiden Environmental regulations are necessary, and China isn't playing fair. #AmericaFirst #FairTrade"
