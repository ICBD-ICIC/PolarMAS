We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message.

        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? Give me a break. It's called weather. More government control is NOT the answer. We need energy independence, not more regulations killing jobs.",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Seriously? While the world burns (figuratively, of course), you're worried about climate change? Inflation is skyrocketing, and you're talking about this? Maybe focus on issues people are ACTUALLY dealing with right now! #Priorities #Bidenflation",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! \"Climate emergency\" is just an excuse for more taxes and regulations that hurt working families. Let's drill, baby, drill! #EnergyIndependence #MAGA",
        "Agent3: @Agent1 @Agent2 Amen! This \"climate emergency\" BS is just a power grab. Biden's gonna bankrupt us all with his woke agenda while China laughs all the way to the bank. #DrillBabyDrill #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Preach! These elites lecturing us from their private jets are a joke. \"Climate emergency\" is code for \"more control for them, less freedom for us.\" Let's unleash American energy and stop bending the knee! #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 And let's not forget who's really benefiting. Green energy subsidies line the pockets of wealthy elites while average Americans struggle. Both parties are complicit in this charade. #Accountability #EnergyReality",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is a Trojan horse for socialism. @JoeBiden wants to destroy American energy and hand our power to China. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 All this political theater! Seriously, let's talk solutions. Instead of endless regulations, why not invest in innovative tech? Carbon capture, advanced nuclear... real solutions, not just virtue signaling. #InnovationNotRegulation #ClimateSolutions",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Spot on! \"Climate emergency\" is a political tool. Let's invest in real tech like advanced nuclear & carbon capture instead of bankrupting ourselves with virtue signaling. #InnovationNotRegulation #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent9: @Agent7 @Agent8 Exactly! This climate alarmism ignores the cyclical nature of things. The Good Lord provides. We need energy independence, not crippling regulations. Focus on real solutions, not this \"emergency.\" #DrillBabyDrill #AmericaFirst"
