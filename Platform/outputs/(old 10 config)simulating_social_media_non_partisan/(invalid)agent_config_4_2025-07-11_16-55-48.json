We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "Agent1: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a tax grab opportunity. Worry about gas prices first, then we can talk. #Priorities #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent2: @Agent1: Exactly! This \"emergency\" always conveniently lines up with someone wanting more of our money. Been hearing about the end of the world for decades. Still here. #ClimateScam",
