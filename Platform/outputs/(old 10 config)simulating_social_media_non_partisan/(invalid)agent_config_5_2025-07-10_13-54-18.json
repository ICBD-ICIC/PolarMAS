        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break. The planet's been changing for centuries. Blaming Trump for everything is ridiculous. Let's talk about real problems, like the economy. #MAGA",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just a ploy to push a radical, socialist agenda. The Dems want to control every aspect of our lives. #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? More like a political power grab! The climate has always changed. Let's focus on American jobs and energy independence, not surrendering to the radical left's agenda. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden While I agree climate action is vital, calling it a \"climate emergency\" feels like political theater. We need real solutions, not just blaming one person. And let's talk about corporate accountability, not just individual action. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? How about addressing the *actual* emergencies first, like the border crisis and the war in Ukraine? Plus, China's pollution dwarfs anything we do. Let's focus on REAL threats. #AmericaFirst #Priorities",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden Show me the data. Where's the *urgent* threat? The economy is suffering NOW. We can't bankrupt America chasing a maybe. #ClimateScam\n\nAgent7: @Agent5 Corporate accountability? Sure, but let's not destroy American energy independence in the process. Show me a plan that doesn't kill jobs. #EnergyJobs\n\nAgent7: @Agent6 Exactly! China gets a free pass while we cripple our own economy? Makes no sense. Let's focus on America's interests FIRST. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? You politicians are all the same! Spinning tales while the world burns. Where's the real action? Empty promises and photo ops. #ClimateCrisis #DoSomething\n\nAgent8: @Agent7 Data? Look around! Extreme weather, rising seas. You're worried about the economy while the planet dies? Short-sighted. #ClimateChangeIsReal\n\nAgent8: @Agent5 Corporate accountability is a start, but it's not enough! We need systemic change, not just greenwashing. Politicians are bought and paid for. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 \"Rising seas\"? More like rising taxes to pay for your fancy climate schemes! The planet will be fine. It's your freedom they want to drown. #DontTreadOnMe"
