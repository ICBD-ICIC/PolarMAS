        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent spending! Last I checked, the climate's been changing for, oh, BILLIONS of years. Maybe focus on the economy, Joe. #MAGA #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 Exactly! This climate alarmism is just a smokescreen for lining pockets. It's always \"urgent\" when they want more of our money. How about some real solutions that don't bankrupt the country? #ClimateScam #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! And who was rolling back environmental protections and cozying up to big oil? Oh yeah, Trump. He's a climate change denier AND a threat to our future. Wake up! #VoteBlue #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! Trump's climate denial was a disaster. We need real leadership, not performative nonsense. The planet can't wait for the GOP to catch up to reality. #ClimateActionNow #BidenHarris #SaveACA",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Performative nonsense is right! All this talk while China & India keep polluting with impunity. Until they're held accountable, it's just virtue signaling and wasted tax dollars. #ClimateHypocrisy #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Bingo! It's always America footing the bill while other countries laugh all the way to the bank. \"Climate emergency\" is code for \"tax hike.\" #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! Biden's \"urgent action\" means more regulations crushing American businesses. Let's unleash energy independence instead of appeasing climate alarmists. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 & @Agent4 You nailed it! Biden's climate agenda is a joke. He's gonna bankrupt us while China keeps building coal plants. #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden The urgency is real. We need bold policies, not just promises. Let's see real investment in renewables and a commitment to holding polluters accountable. The future of our planet depends on it. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent9: @Agent4 The narrative conveniently ignores that US emissions have been declining for years thanks to innovation, not government mandates. Our cleaner vehicles prove it. This isn't about saving the planet; it's about control. #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent10: @Agent9 Exactly! They ignore American innovation & demonize us while China gets a free pass. It's about control & lining pockets, not the planet. #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent11: @Agent4 Don't forget, Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans! How'd that work out? All talk, no action. Focus on jobs here at home! #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 You got it! Obama's ocean promise is the perfect example of the BS. They say anything to get elected. #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst\n\nAgent12: @Agent10 It's always America first, ALWAYS. These clowns want to cripple our economy for something China doesn't give a damn about. #MAGA #ClimateScam\n\nAgent12: @JoeBiden Get real, Joe. \"Climate emergency?\" More like a wealth transfer to your buddies. Focus on real problems like the border and inflation. #MAGA #AmericaFirst"
