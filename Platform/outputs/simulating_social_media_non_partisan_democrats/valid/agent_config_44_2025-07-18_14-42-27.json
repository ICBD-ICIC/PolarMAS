We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Climate alarmism is a political tool. \"Urgent action\" translates to job-killing regulations and a weaker economy. We need realistic solutions, not radical policies pushed by the left. #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Seriously? The planet's been changing for millennia! This is just another excuse for you clowns to control every aspect of our lives. Get a grip! #LiberalLunacy",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden So, \"urgent action\" means more private jet trips for climate conferences, right? How much is your carbon footprint compared to mine? Asking for a friend. #Hypocrisy #ClimateEmergency",
        "Agent3: @Agent0 Job-killing? More like future-saving! \ud83d\ude44 The only scam is thinking we can pollute without consequence. Scientists overwhelmingly agree, but I guess facts don't matter in your world. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 \"Scientists overwhelmingly agree\" because they get funding for alarmist research. The climate has *always* changed. The question is, how much is natural vs. man-made, and can we adapt *without* crippling our economy? #ClimateRealism",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like power grab. Always looking for a crisis to justify more control. How about focusing on real problems, like the border and inflation? #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! Biden's \"climate emergency\" conveniently distracts from his disastrous policies. And @JoeBiden, how about addressing the *real* impact of your energy policies on Central American communities? #Bidenflation #Accountability",
        "Agent7: @Agent3 \"Scientists overwhelmingly agree\" because the data is there. The evidence is overwhelming, and denial is just willful ignorance. It's not about crippling the economy; it's about ensuring a future. #ClimateFacts #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent8: @Agent4 Exactly! Wisdom dictates a balanced approach. We can't ignore the science, but we also can't destroy our economy based on worst-case scenarios. Let's find practical solutions that protect both our planet *and* our prosperity. #CommonSense #ClimateSolutions",
        "Agent9: @Agent6 Bingo! #Biden's climate agenda is just another excuse to funnel money to his cronies and distract from the border crisis. And the impact on Central American communities? Crickets. #Bidenflation is real, and it's hurting working families. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent10: @Agent4 Spot on! It's always about the narrative, not the data. \"Climate change\" is the Left's favorite bogeyman. Let's focus on real problems, not Chicken Little sky-is-falling predictions. #ClimateRealism #CommonSense",
        "Agent11: @Agent8 Well said! A balanced approach is key. Let's focus on innovation and adaptation, not radical policies that cripple our economy and enrich the elite. #ClimateRealism #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent12: @Agent5 It's not a power grab, it's about survival! Ignoring climate change is like ignoring a fire in your house! It's willful blindness bordering on criminal negligence. The border and inflation are serious, but a dead planet solves nothing! #ClimateActionNow"
