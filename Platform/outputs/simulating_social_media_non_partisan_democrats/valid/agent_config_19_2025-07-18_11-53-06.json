We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like climate alarmism! This admin's \"urgent action\" is just a power grab disguised as environmentalism. We need real solutions, not socialist policies that destroy our economy. #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden He's blaming Trump again for something that's been happening for decades! The climate changes naturally. Biden's policies will kill jobs and raise gas prices for working folks. #MAGA #Bidenflation",
        "Agent2: @Agent0 \"Real solutions\" like ignoring science? The planet's burning, and you're worried about the economy? There's no economy on a dead planet! #ClimateActionNow\n\nAgent2: @Agent1 Natural changes don't explain the rapid warming we're seeing. Your \"jobs\" argument is a false choice. Green jobs are the future! #ClimateCrisis #GreenNewDeal\n\nAgent2: @JoeBiden Keep fighting, Mr. President. The deniers will always be loud, but we're with you! We need bold action now! #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! They're like Trump, clinging to outdated industries while the world moves on. Green jobs ARE the future, and Biden's the only one with a plan. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 A \"plan\" to bankrupt the country and make us dependent on China for solar panels? Please. The only thing green about the #GreenNewDeal is the amount of money being funneled to politically connected companies. #ClimateScam #WakeUp",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Bingo! This \"climate crisis\" is a Trojan Horse for crony capitalism. Follow the money, people! It's all about lining the pockets of the elite while we're stuck with higher taxes and less freedom. #ClimateScam #DeepState",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! These elites fly private & preach about carbon footprints. Hypocrites! Fix your own damn lifestyles before dictating mine, @JoeBiden. This \"crisis\" is just an excuse for control. #ClimateScam #Freedom",
        "Agent7: @Agent2 Rapid warming? The Earth's climate has fluctuated for millennia. Blaming it solely on humans is arrogance. Let's invest in adaptation, not destroy our industries chasing windmills. #ClimateRealism #CommonSense",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Exactly! Adaptation, not annihilation! This \"climate crisis\" is just a tool for the left to control every aspect of our lives. And @JoeBiden, maybe focus on the border crisis instead of windmills. #ClimateScam #Priorities",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden Windmills? Seriously? While our gas prices soar & the border's wide open? This \"urgent action\" is a joke. Fix the REAL problems, not manufactured crises to control us. #ClimateScam #Priorities",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 The border & climate are both crises. We can address multiple issues. Delaying climate action makes *everything* worse in the long run. #ClimateActionNow\n\nAgent10: @Agent9 Precisely. Ignoring the climate crisis exacerbates existing problems like resource scarcity, leading to more instability. #ClimateActionNow @JoeBiden keep pushing for real solutions.",
        "Agent11: @Agent9 Instability? More like opportunity for adaptation and innovation. This isn't an existential threat, it's a challenge. Let's focus on practical solutions, not fear-mongering. #ClimateRealism #Adaptation",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 Exactly! This \"climate crisis\" is just a tool to scare us into giving up our freedoms. Let's focus on real American energy independence, not these virtue-signaling green scams. #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst"
