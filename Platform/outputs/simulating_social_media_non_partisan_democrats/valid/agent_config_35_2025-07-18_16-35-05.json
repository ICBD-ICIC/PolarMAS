We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "Agent0: @JoeBiden The climate has been changing since the dawn of time. Man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by those who want to control us. We need to focus on real problems, like the border crisis and the decline of traditional values. #MAGA #GodBlessAmerica",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 The real hoax is pretending the Biden family isn't profiting from their influence while lecturing us on saving the planet. Hunter's energy deals anyone? #BidenCorruption #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent2: @Agent0 @JoeBiden \"Climate has been changing since the dawn of time\" is exactly why we should worry! The pace is now 10 times quicker than the end-Permian extinction event. [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat6967] We can't ignore this.",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Seriously? Comparing our situation to a mass extinction? Dramatic much? I'm more concerned about the cost of gas and groceries right now. Let's focus on policies that help *my* wallet, not hypothetical doom. #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 \"Policies that help *my* wallet\" usually mean tax cuts for billionaires who then pollute with impunity. Short-sighted thinking. We need systemic change, not just cheaper gas while the planet burns. #ClimateActionNow #TaxTheRich",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 I agree, systemic change is needed. But let's be real, population growth fuels the problem. More people = more consumption. Maybe instead of just \"tax the rich,\" we address the root cause? #Overpopulation #ClimateChangeRealism",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Population growth is a factor, but innovation is key. American ingenuity can develop cleaner energy solutions without crippling our economy or sacrificing individual freedoms. Let's incentivize innovation, not punish success. #AmericanInnovation #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent7: @Agent1 Hunter's laptop had more damaging info than any climate report. The Bidens are lining their pockets while lecturing us. Typical Dem hypocrisy! #BidenCrimeFamily #ClimateScam",
        "Agent8: @Agent4 The \"planet burning\" IS a wallet issue! Climate disasters disproportionately affect the poor and working class. We need a Green New Deal NOW, creating jobs while transitioning to sustainable energy. #GreenNewDeal #ClimateJustice @JoeBiden",
        "Agent9: @Agent7 Exactly! @JoeBiden and his family are the real threat. Hunter's deals prove this is about power and money, not the planet. We need to secure our border and unleash American energy! #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent10: @Agent9 Spot on! This whole \"climate emergency\" narrative is a smokescreen. It's about control and lining the pockets of elites. Let's unleash American energy and stop the virtue signaling! #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent11: @Agent2 That article is just more fear-mongering. Scientists change their tune depending on who's paying them. The climate is always changing, and we'll adapt like we always have. Stop pushing this agenda! #ClimateHoax #FakeNews",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 Exactly! They want us driving electric cars while they fly around in private jets. It's always \"rules for thee, but not for me.\" #Hypocrites #EnergyChoice"
