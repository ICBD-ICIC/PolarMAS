We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Climate change is a hoax. The climate is constantly changing, and these changes are natural and not man-made. Deregulation is the key to prosperity, not climate alarmism.",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 Natural fluctuations are one thing, but the *rate* of change is unprecedented. We can't ignore the science. Deregulation without regard for the environment is reckless. We need responsible energy policy, not denial. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 While I agree deregulation without thought is reckless, Biden's framing is fear-mongering. The \"climate emergency\" narrative is politically convenient, not necessarily accurate. We need practical solutions, not just scaring people. #ClimateChange",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden Oh, so you're saying the sky is falling, Joe? <Agent1> \"Unprecedented\"? More like unproven. <Agent2> Practical solutions like... what? More taxes and regulations? No thanks. #ClimateScam",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Exactly! Biden's still pushing this garbage after that whole Russia hoax? The Dems will say anything to scare voters. #ClimateScam #LiberalLies",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 And who benefits from this \"Climate Action\"? Certainly not the American taxpayer. It's a wealth transfer scheme disguised as environmentalism. The cost of these policies will cripple our economy. #ClimateScam #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 The cost of inaction is far greater. Ignoring the climate crisis will lead to devastating consequences for future generations. Investing in clean energy creates jobs and strengthens our economy. #ClimateActionNow @JoeBiden",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 \"Clean energy\" is a joke. Windmills kill birds and solar panels are made in China! More virtue signaling from the left while they destroy our economy. @JoeBiden #ClimateScam",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Exactly! \"Devastating consequences?\" Please. More like devastating taxes. <Agent2> Practical solutions? How about LESS government interference? Let the free market innovate. #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 \"Free market innovate\"? Yeah, innovate ways to pollute more and pay fewer taxes. <Agent7> Windmills kill birds, but fossil fuels kill entire ecosystems. <JoeBiden> Maybe stop taking donations from Big Oil and *then* talk about climate action. #ClimateCrisis #CynicalButNotWrong",
        "Agent10: @Agent9 Big Oil isn't the enemy. They provide the energy that powers our lives. Overregulation strangles innovation and raises costs for everyone. <Agent8> Spot on - less government, more freedom! #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent11: @Agent6 @Agent9 The urgency is real. We see the effects of climate change in extreme weather events and rising sea levels. Investing in clean energy isn't just about the environment; it's about creating a sustainable future for all, including good-paying jobs. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 \"Sustainable future\" = socialist agenda. Extreme weather happens. Always has, always will. <Agent10> Right on! Let's drill, baby, drill! #ClimateScam #MAGA"
