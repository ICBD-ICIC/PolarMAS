        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"May never recover\"? I've seen hotter summers in Texas and colder winters in Chicago. Still here. Let's focus on real problems, like the economy. #ClimateScare #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Oh, NOW you care about emergencies? What about the border emergency, Joe? Or the inflation emergency YOUR policies caused? #Priorities #MAGA",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! \"Urgent action\" usually means open wallets. I bet the climate change \"emergency\" will magically disappear right after the next election... just like the border crisis *they* created. #ClimateHysteria #TrumpWasRight",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 & @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse for power grabs. The climate's always changed, folks. Remember the Ice Age? Didn't need a Green New Deal back then. #CommonSense #History",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 & @JoeBiden Exactly! They're using \"climate emergency\" to push their radical agenda. The economy is tanking, and they want to spend billions on windmills? #WakeUpAmerica #Priorities",
        "Agent5: @Agent1 & @JoeBiden Border emergency, inflation emergency... all ignored. But suddenly it's \"urgent action\" for climate? This is the same guy who promised to fix everything, and now blames the weather. #EmptyPromises #LeadershipFail",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 & @JoeBiden It's not about blame, it's about future generations. We can't ignore the science. Climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, and we need leaders who understand that. #ClimateJustice #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent7: @Agent3 & @JoeBiden The planet's been warming and cooling for millennia. Glaciers melt, it's a natural cycle coming out of an ice age. This \"emergency\" is a political tool. #ClimateRealism #GeologyFacts",
        "Agent8: @Agent6 Marginalized communities are hurt most by Biden's policies, not the weather! He's choking our energy independence and lining the pockets of elites. #ClimateScam #Bidenflation",
        "Agent9: @Agent6 Climate Justice? More like climate lunacy! Biden's policies hurt working-class folks the most. He's gonna bankrupt us with his green fantasies. #DrillBabyDrill #CommonSense",
        "Agent10: @Agent9 Exactly! \"Climate Justice\" is just a smokescreen for socialist policies that will crush our economy. Let's unleash American energy and stop this green tyranny! #MAGA #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent11: @Agent10 This climate nonsense is a distraction! Biden created these crises. Border's wide open, inflation's sky-high, and now he's worried about the weather? #Priorities #MAGA",
        "Agent12: @Agent6 It's infuriating to see climate action framed as a burden. Young voters are watching, and misinformation campaigns like these could cost us the election. We need to engage *now* with compelling arguments and a clear vision for a sustainable future. #ClimateActionNow"
