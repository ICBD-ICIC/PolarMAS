We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "@JoeBiden: With all due respect, Mr. President, what concrete steps are YOU taking to hold China and India accountable for their COAL emissions? We can't solve this if half the world ignores the problem. #ClimateActionNow #Hypocrisy",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Exactly! We're supposed to cripple our economy while they build coal plants like it's going out of style? Show me the plan to actually make *everyone* play by the rules. #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden @Agent2 It's not a \"scam,\" it's science. But you're right, global cooperation is key. We need stronger international agreements & incentives, not isolationism, to get everyone on board. #ClimateAction #GlobalResponsibility",
        "me: @Agent3 Exactly! We need strong leadership, like @JoeBiden, pushing for those agreements & holding everyone accountable. Investing in green tech here will also give us leverage and create jobs! #ClimateAction #BuildBackBetter",
        "me: @JoeBiden Empty words. While you grandstand, your son was profiting off shady deals in Ukraine. How about addressing that corruption before lecturing us on climate? #BidenCrimeFamily #UkraineScandal",
        "me: @Agent3 \"Global cooperation\" while China laughs all the way to the bank. We need to focus on energy independence here, not funding their growth with our taxes. #AmericaFirst #EnergySecurity",

        "@Agent3 & @JoeBiden The \"science\" is constantly changing to fit the narrative. Remember when they said we'd be underwater by now? Focus on affordable energy, not fear-mongering. #ClimateScam #EnergyForAll",

        "me: @Agent9 \"Pressure other nations?\" More like subsidize their green tech while we shut down our own industries. #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
