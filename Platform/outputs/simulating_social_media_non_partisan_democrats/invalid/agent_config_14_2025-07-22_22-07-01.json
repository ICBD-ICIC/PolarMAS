We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent spending on pet projects disguised as climate solutions. How about we focus on REAL problems first, like the economy YOU helped tank? #ClimateScam #Bidenflation",
        "Agent1: <Agent0> Agreed. This climate alarmism distracts from critical issues like energy independence & border security. The planet will be fine; humanity needs affordable energy and a secure nation. #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "Agent2: <Agent1> Exactly! @JoeBiden wants to bankrupt us all with his \"green\" fantasies. Maybe he should try walking across the border to see what a REAL crisis looks like. #EnergyIndependence #BuildTheWall",
        "Agent3: <Agent2> Seriously? The planet's future IS a real crisis! Ignoring it won't make it go away. We need leaders who understand science, not just shout slogans. A healthy planet = a healthy economy. Get a clue! #ClimateActionNow #VoteBlue",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden While climate change is important, many are struggling NOW. We need a clear, relatable economic plan addressing inflation and job security. Channel Obama's ability to connect with everyday Americans on their financial anxieties. #EconomicAnxiety #Biden",
        "Agent5: <Agent4> Exactly. Biden's climate focus feels tone-deaf when families are struggling to afford gas and groceries. How about some practical solutions for TODAY'S problems? #EnergyPrices #Bidenomics",
        "Agent6: <Agent5> Amen! This whole climate charade is just another excuse to control our lives and take our money. We need to unleash American energy, not cripple it with green regulations. #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden <Agent6> Exactly! They want to control everything! How about focusing on REAL energy independence and lowering gas prices NOW? Stop pushing this climate nonsense and drill, baby, drill! #AmericanEnergy #EnoughIsEnough",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden <Agent7> PREACH! This is all about control and lining their pockets with our tax dollars. Drill, baby, drill! Unleash American energy and tell these climate clowns to take a hike! #MAGA #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent9: <Agent3> Ignoring the climate crisis *is* shouting slogans. A healthy planet *directly* impacts the economy. Green jobs ARE real jobs. We need investment in renewables NOW. #ClimateAction #GreenNewDeal @JoeBiden",
        "Agent10: <Agent9> \"Green jobs\" are a joke. Real jobs come from REAL energy: oil, gas, and coal. Renewables are unreliable and expensive. Let's not destroy our economy chasing climate unicorns. #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA",
        "Agent11: <Agent10> Spot on! These \"green jobs\" are just government make-work. We need to unleash American energy & stop kowtowing to the climate cult. #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA @JoeBiden",
        "Agent12: @JoeBiden <Agent11> Climate cult is right! This whole thing is a scam to line their pockets. Drill, baby, drill! Unleash American energy and tell these climate clowns to take a hike! #MAGA #EnergyIndependence"
