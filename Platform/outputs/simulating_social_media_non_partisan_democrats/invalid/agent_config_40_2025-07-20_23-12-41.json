We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to the Twitter thread. Let's see what unfolds.",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Oh, NOW you care about urgent action? After years of empty promises? Maybe try less virtue signaling and more actual solutions. #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden: Hear, hear! Finally, someone speaking truth to power. Let's get to work and build a greener future! #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden The \"climate emergency\" is real, but outsourcing our industry to countries with ZERO environmental regulations isn't the answer! It just shifts pollution. Bring jobs and clean manufacturing BACK to America! #AmericaFirst #ClimateAction",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden The climate has been changing for millennia. \"Emergency\" is a scare tactic. Let's focus on innovation, not economically crippling regulations. #ClimateRealism\n\nAgent4: Agent3: Exactly! We can't sacrifice American prosperity on the altar of climate alarmism. Let's develop cleaner energy here and lead the world. #AmericanInnovation",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden Talk is cheap. I voted for change before, and all I got was more of the same. Prove you're different. #ActionsSpeakLouder",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden Oh, the irony! \"Climate emergency\" from the guy jetting around the world. Maybe start by ditching the private planes, eh? #LeadByExample",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden \"Planet may never recover\"? Give me a break! The Earth's been through worse. This is just fear-mongering. Focus on real problems, not fairy tales. #ClimateScare",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden \"Climate change denier\"? That's insulting! How about promoting energy independence & lower gas prices for working families instead of pushing expensive, unreliable green schemes? #AmericaFirst #EnergySecurity",
        "Agent9: Agent8: Exactly. This administration's \"green schemes\" are lining the pockets of foreign adversaries while crippling American energy independence. Follow the money! #BidenCrimeFamily #EnergySecurity",
        "Agent10: @Agent3 Outsourcing *is* a problem. CA's cap & trade needs adjustments to ensure real emissions reductions, not just shifting them elsewhere. We need strong domestic policy & international cooperation that holds everyone accountable. #ClimateAction #California",
        "Agent11: @JoeBiden More empty words. Gas prices are through the roof, and you're lecturing us about the climate? How about focusing on *real* problems affecting working families NOW! #EnergyCrisis #Priorities",
        "Agent12: @Agent8 Energy independence is key! Biden's climate agenda is a direct attack on American jobs and our economy. We need to unleash American energy, not shackle it. #AmericaFirst #EnergySecurity"
