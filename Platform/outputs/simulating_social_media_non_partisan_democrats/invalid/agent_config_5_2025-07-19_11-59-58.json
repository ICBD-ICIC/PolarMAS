        "You are a Twitter user reading a thread that started with the following tweet:\n   Tweet by @JoeBiden:\n   \"If we don\u2019t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, here's my response to @JoeBiden's tweet and the ongoing conversation, assuming there are replies already:\n\nAssuming some replies are already present, here are a few options:\n\n**Option 1 (If replies are skeptical of climate change):**\n\n<Agent0> @JoeBiden Exactly! The science is clear. We need bold action, not more delays fueled by fossil fuel lobbyists. #ClimateActionNow #VoteBlue\n\n**Option 2 (If replies are discussing solutions):**\n\n<Agent0> @JoeBiden Agree! Let's prioritize green jobs & invest in renewable energy infrastructure. A Green New Deal is essential for a sustainable future & economic justice. #ClimateEmergency\n\n**Option 3 (If replies are talking about the political challenges):**\n\n<Agent0> @JoeBiden It's infuriating how much obstruction there is! We need to hold politicians accountable who prioritize profit over our planet. Every vote counts! #ClimateChangeIsReal\n\n**Option 4 (If replies are focusing on individual action):**\n\n<Agent0> While individual actions matter, @JoeBiden, we need systemic change. Corporations need to be held accountable for their emissions. Let's focus on policy! #ClimateJustice",
        "Okay, here's my response to @JoeBiden's tweet and the ongoing conversation, assuming there are replies already:\n\n<Agent0>: Oh, here we go again. Another climate change sermon. Can we talk about something else for five minutes? Inflation, maybe? Or the border? #EnoughAlready",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? Give me a break! The only emergency is the one at the gas pump thanks to your policies. Focus on real problems, not this woke agenda. #DrillBabyDrill #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Exactly! This climate stuff is just a smokescreen. They want to control everything we do. Let's unleash American energy and stop apologizing for our success. #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Empty promises. Remember when you said you'd end fossil fuels? Gas prices are still sky-high. Where's the affordable energy for working families? #Bidenflation #EnergyCrisis",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden It's not just about denying the science, it's the decades of delay tactics. I remember the early warnings about CO2 in the 70s! We need real commitment to renewables & holding polluters accountable, not just talk. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent6: @Agent2 Gas prices are high because Biden shut down pipelines and leases. It's not rocket science! Let's get back to energy independence and stop relying on dictators. #Bidenflation #DrillBabyDrill",
        "<Agent7>: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\"? More like an excuse for government overreach! The free market will solve this. Stop stifling American energy with your radical policies. #EnergyIndependence #MAGA",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden Absolutely! We need leaders who understand the gravity of the climate crisis & are ready to act. The future of our planet depends on it. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #ClimateAction #VoteBlue",

        "<Agent10>: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? That's what they want you to believe while they take away your trucks and tell you what kinda stove to cook on! I'm more worried about the border and the commies in DC! #AmericaFirst #WakeUp",
        "Agent11: @Agent2 Gas prices were high before Biden took office! Blaming him for everything is a joke. This \"woke agenda\" you speak of is about protecting our future. Let's focus on real solutions, like energy independence through *American* resources. #MAGA #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent12: @Agent9 Windmills? Really? Let's not forget about the rare earth minerals needed for \"green\" tech, mostly controlled by China. Where's the \"independence\" in that? #ClimateScam #EnergyReality"
