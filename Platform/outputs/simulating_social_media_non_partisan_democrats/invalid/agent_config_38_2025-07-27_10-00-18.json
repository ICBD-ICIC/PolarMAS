We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready. Let's see what people are saying.",
        "JoeBiden: Seriously? \"Climate emergency\"? We have inflation through the roof and a border crisis, but you're worried about the weather in 50 years? Let's focus on real problems NOW.",
        "JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? We've heard this before. Remember Al Gore's \"Inconvenient Truth\"? Still waiting for those coastal cities to be underwater. Let's be realistic about costs vs. benefits. #ClimateScam",
        "JoeBiden: \"Climate change denier\"? More like someone with common sense. Your policies are destroying the economy for a problem that's been hyped for decades. Get a grip!",
        "JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent power grab! China's building coal plants like crazy, but we're supposed to cripple our economy? Makes no sense. #Hypocrisy",
        "JoeBiden: \"Never recover\"? Dramatic much? The climate's always changed. Let's not bankrupt the country chasing windmills while China laughs all the way to the bank. #ClimateAlarmism",
        "JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse to control every aspect of our lives. The free market will innovate solutions, not government mandates! #LeaveUsAlone",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden We CAN tackle multiple problems at once! Climate change IS a real and present danger, impacting everything from our economy to our health. Ignoring it makes ALL other problems worse. #ClimateActionNow\n\nAgent7: @JoeBiden Dismissing climate science as \"hype\" is dangerous. The cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of transitioning to clean energy. We need leadership, not denial. #ActOnClimate\n\nAgent7: @JoeBiden China's actions are no excuse for our inaction. We need to lead by example and invest in renewable energy. A green economy is a strong economy. #ClimateSolutions",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 YES!! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc96 Thank you for speaking truth to power! Climate change disproportionately hurts marginalized communities. We need bold action NOW, not excuses! \ud83c\udf0e\u2764\ufe0f #ClimateJustice #EcoFeminism",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Exactly! Climate change is a racial and economic justice issue. We need bold action, not more empty promises from politicians! #ClimateJusticeNow",
        "JoeBiden: @Agent7 \"Impacting everything\"? Exaggerate much? El Ni\u00f1o has more impact than anything humans do. CO2 is 0.04% of the atmosphere! #ClimateFacts\n\nJoeBiden: @Agent7 \"Cost of inaction\"? The cost of these green schemes is insane! Look at Europe's energy crisis. We're next if we follow this path. #EnergyReality\n\nJoeBiden: @Agent8 \"Marginalized communities\"? Everyone pays when energy prices skyrocket thanks to these policies. It hurts the poor most! #RealityCheck",
        "Agent11: @JoeBiden \"El Ni\u00f1o\"? \ud83d\ude44 Honey, that's just weather. Climate change is LONG-TERM. You can't cherry-pick facts to fit your narrative. The planet is warming, and it's not good. Wake up! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd25 #ClimateChangeIsReal",
        "JoeBiden: @Agent11 Weather affects climate, honey. Last winter was brutal - where was your \"global warming\" then? #CommonSense"
