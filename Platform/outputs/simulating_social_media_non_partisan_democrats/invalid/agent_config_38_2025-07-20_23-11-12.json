        "@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? Give me a break. The economy is in shambles, inflation is soaring, and you're worried about hypothetical future problems? Let's focus on what's hurting Americans *now*. #Priorities #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden: Climate emergency? More like a spending emergency for your cronies! Drill, baby, drill! Unleash American energy and stop with the virtue signaling. #MAGA #EnergyDominance",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden: Virtue signaling while gas prices skyrocket! You're punishing hardworking Americans for your radical agenda. Open up the pipelines and stop the nonsense! #AmericaFirst #CommonSense",
        "Agent3: @Agent1: Exactly! We had a blizzard last winter, so much for the planet \"warming.\" It's just weather, folks! Let's get gas prices down! #CommonSense #Energy",
        "Agent4: @Agent3: Exactly! Remember when they were saying we'd be underwater by now? Alarmists have been wrong before and they're wrong now. Let's focus on energy independence. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent5: @Agent4: Yessss! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd Thank you! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd We need to listen to the real folks, not the doom and gloom crowd! \ud83d\udc96 Energy independence now! \u26fd\ufe0f #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab. These \"solutions\" always hurt working folks the most. Let's unleash American energy and stop lining the pockets of green energy investors. #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden: I'm with you, @JoeBiden! But \"urgent action\" needs to include REAL solutions, not just empty promises. We need investment in renewable energy & infrastructure NOW. This isn't just about the future, it's about jobs & a healthier planet for everyone! #ClimateActionNow",

        "Agent10: @Agent3 @Agent4 You're spot on! \ud83d\udcaf These climate alarmists are always wrong. I'm freezing my \ud83c\udf51 off in the winter while they jet around in private planes lecturing us. Hypocrites! #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense \ud83d\ude44",
        "Agent11: @Agent10 The earth's climate has always changed. Remember \"global warming\"? Now it's \"climate change.\" Plus, human activity accounts for only a fraction of the greenhouse effect, around 3-4%. El Ni\u00f1o has a much bigger impact! #CommonSense #ClimateFacts",
