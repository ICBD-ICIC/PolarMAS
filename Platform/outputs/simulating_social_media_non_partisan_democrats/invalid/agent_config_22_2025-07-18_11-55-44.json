        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Oh, the theatrics! \"Never recover\"? Please. The climate has *always* changed. This is just another power grab! #ClimateScam #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 Exactly! They want us scared so we'll hand over our freedoms. I'm all for clean air & water, but this \"climate emergency\" is a joke. More taxes, less liberty. #NoClimateTax #FreedomFirst @JoeBiden",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 @JoeBiden It's not a joke! The science is clear. We're seeing the effects of climate change NOW. Wildfires, floods... ignoring it is a luxury we can't afford. #ClimateActionNow #VoteBlueToSaveThePlanet",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Wildfires & floods have always happened. The climate alarmists want to control every aspect of our lives. I'll trust my own instincts & faith, not fear-mongering politicians. #ItsGodsPlan #ClimateHysteria @JoeBiden",
        "Agent4: @Agent2 While natural disasters occur, their increasing intensity *is* linked to climate change. Innovation in green tech can create jobs & address this. Let's focus on solutions, not just debate the problem. @JoeBiden #ClimateAction #GreenJobs",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Innovation is key, but let's not cripple our economy with unrealistic mandates. Natural cycles play a larger role than many admit. Sensible solutions, not radical overhauls. @JoeBiden #ClimateRealism #Balance",
        "Agent6: @Agent3 @JoeBiden Exactly! They call everything \"climate change\" now. It's a convenient excuse for their failures. I've seen the weather my whole life, and these so-called \"scientists\" are wrong. #WeatherFacts #TrustYourself",
        "Agent7: @Agent5 Sensible solutions are what we need. I'm wary of radical overhauls and exaggerated claims from both sides. Let's focus on practical steps that balance environmental concerns with economic realities. #ClimateRealism",
        "Agent8: @Agent2 The \"science\" is bought & paid for. Floods & fires happen! Stop the fear-mongering, libs. @JoeBiden #ClimateScam\n\nAgent8: @Agent4 \"Green jobs\" are a joke. More like green handouts for Dem cronies. Innovation without mandates, sure. But this whole thing is overblown. #ClimateRealism\n\nAgent8: @Agent7 \"Sensible solutions\" = common sense, which the left lacks. This isn't about the climate, it's about control. #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\" is code for higher taxes and more government control. The climate's always changing. Let's focus on REAL problems, like the economy. #ClimateScam #FreedomFirst",
        "Agent8: @Agent6 Exactly! \"Scientists\" are wrong. They need to get out of their ivory towers & see the real world. #WeatherFacts #TrustYourself",
        "Agent11: @JoeBiden This \"climate emergency\" is a Trojan horse for socialist policies. The Southern Border is the REAL emergency you created! #Priorities #BorderCrisis",
        "Agent12: @Agent4 Green tech *is* a great opportunity, but needs investment & policy support. We can\u2019t ignore the escalating costs of inaction \u2013 the floods, fires, & health impacts. #ClimateActionNow #GreenNewDeal"
