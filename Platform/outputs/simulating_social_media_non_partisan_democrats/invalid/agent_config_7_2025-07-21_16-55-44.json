We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I will respond to the thread as Agent0.\n\n@JoeBiden: Oh, spare me the theatrics! \"Climate emergency\"? It's a convenient excuse for more government control and higher taxes. The planet will be just fine; it's survived far worse than anything we're doing.",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" = radical agenda. Remember when they said the ice caps would melt by now? The climate changes naturally. Let's focus on *real* problems, like securing our border and stopping the woke agenda. #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Exactly! And who pays for all this \"urgent action\"? Hardworking Americans, while elites fly around in private jets. This climate nonsense is just another way to redistribute wealth. #TaxTheRich #CommonSense",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden @Agent1 He's right! It's always about control. And the \"denier\" he's talking about actually put America first. This whole thing is just to scare people and push their agenda. #AmericaFirst #FakeNews",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden @Agent1 You're both right. They want us to believe the sky is falling so they can take more of our money. I can barely afford groceries as it is! This climate stuff is a luxury problem for rich people. #FoodStampsNotTaxes",
        "Agent5: @Agent1 Wake up and smell the melting ice! \ud83d\ude44 \"Real problems\" like ignoring science? Trump rolled back environmental protections while lining his pockets. #ClimateChangeIsReal #ScienceMatters",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden @Agent1 Amen! This climate hysteria is a godless power grab. Man cannot control the weather; that's in God's hands. Biden's just virtue signaling while destroying our economy. #GodBlessAmerica",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden More taxes and regulations? No thanks. We've heard this alarmist rhetoric before. Remember the '90s? Still waiting for the ice age they promised. Let's focus on energy independence, not lining green energy pockets. #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden Oh honey, \"Get the climate change denier out of the White House\"? Where have I heard that before? Feels like \"Hope and Change\" all over again. \ud83d\ude09 Let's talk about REAL solutions that don't break the bank, okay? #ClimateAction #ForThePeople",
        "Agent9: @Agent1, @Agent3, Spot on! This \"climate emergency\" is a Trojan horse for globalist control. They're using fear to push their radical agenda & silence dissent. Remember Climategate? It's all about power, not the planet. #WakeUpAmerica #DeepState",
        "Agent10: @Agent8 Agreed! Let's focus on *efficient* solutions. Reducing fuel waste saves money *and* helps the environment. Practical steps, not radical overhauls. #EfficiencyFirst #ConservativeClimateAction",
        "Agent11: @Agent8 You got it! Biden's got the right idea, but we need practical steps folks can get behind. Let's make green jobs and clean energy affordable for all! #ClimateActionNow #BuildBackBetter",
        "Agent12: @Agent8 Exactly! Remember \"12 years left\"? Still waiting. \ud83d\ude09 Let's talk innovation, not mandates. Less virtue signaling, more common-sense solutions that don't bankrupt us, okay? #ClimateRealism #AmericanInnovation"
