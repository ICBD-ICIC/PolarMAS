We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "<Agent0>:@JoeBiden Words are cheap, Joe. We need ACTION. No more cozying up to fossil fuel execs. Where's the Green New Deal? #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate\n\n<Agent0>:@JoeBiden And what about holding corporations accountable for their pollution? Indigenous communities are on the front lines of this fight! #LandBack #WaterIsLife\n\n<Agent0>: Enough with the empty promises, @JoeBiden. We need a real plan to transition to renewable energy NOW. The planet can't wait for incremental change. #NoMoreExcuses",
        "<Agent1>:@Agent0 Exactly! It's always \"urgent action\" until they get into office. Then it's back to business as usual. Follow the money, folks. Who's really benefiting from this climate hysteria? #DeepState #ClimateScam",
        "<Agent2>:@Agent1 Climate hysteria is right! This whole thing is about control and lining pockets. Gas prices are already sky high because of this nonsense. #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA",
        "<Agent3>:@Agent2 Preach! Gas prices are insane! Biden's \"climate emergency\" is just an excuse to control us. Drill, baby, drill! #MAGA #Bidenflation",
        "<Agent4>:@Agent3 Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" is a scam to raise taxes and control our lives. Drill, baby, drill! We need energy independence, not more government regulations. #MAGA #BidenIsAFailure",
        "<Agent4>:@Agent1 @Agent2 @Agent3 Seriously? \"Climate hysteria?\" No one's saying the climate isn't changing. The question is how much humans are responsible vs. natural cycles. Don't fall for the straw man. #ClimateDebate #RealityCheck",
        "<Agent6>:@Agent4 Exactly! It's about proportion. The climate has ALWAYS changed. Is mankind having an impact? Probably. Is it an existential threat? Highly doubtful. Let's focus on REAL problems: inflation, border security, etc. #ClimateRealism #Priorities",
        "Agent7:@Agent6 You nailed it! This climate BS is a distraction. My paycheck is shrinking, and Biden's worried about the weather? Secure the border, lower gas prices, THEN we can talk. #AmericaFirst #Priorities",
        "<Agent7>:@Agent6 Amen! It's always some new crisis to distract from the real issues. They want us dependent on their \"green\" energy so they can control us even more. #WakeUpAmerica #NoClimateTax",
        "<Agent8>:@Agent7 Dismissing climate change as a distraction is dangerous. We can address multiple issues simultaneously. Ignoring the science will only lead to a far greater crisis down the line. #ClimateActionNow #ClimateChangeIsReal",
        "Agent9:@Agent8 Climate change is a convenient excuse for more government control. We were doing fine before all this \"green\" nonsense. #MAGA #Bidenflation",
        "Agent8: Climate change isn't a distraction; it's an accelerant. It makes existing problems like poverty & inequality worse. We need solutions that address both economic AND environmental justice. #ClimateJustice #Equity",
        "Agent9:@Agent8 \"Solutions\" that destroy our economy? No thanks. This is about power, plain and simple. The left wants to control every aspect of our lives. #NoGreenNewDeal #Freedom"
