        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like emergency spending spree! Last I checked, hot air was coming from DC, not the atmosphere. #MAGA #ClimateScam",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden So, you gonna bankrupt us chasing windmills while China laughs all the way to the bank? How about securing the border first? #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden While climate is important, everyday Americans are struggling. How about some real talk about *their* financial emergencies? Less lecturing, more solutions for kitchen-table issues. We need an Obama-style economic plan, not just climate promises. #EconomicAnxiety",

        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Exactly! They'll tax us into oblivion while blaming cows for the weather. #NoClimateTax\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Border security, jobs, and affordable energy are real emergencies. This climate stuff is a distraction. #Priorities\n\nAgent1: @JoeBiden Don't forget inflation! Climate policies will just make it worse. #CostOfLiving",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Obama's economic plan? Remember the slow growth? Let's not repeat history. Focus on energy independence, not climate virtue signaling. #DrillBabyDrill\n\nAgent1: @JoeBiden Yep, climate policies = higher prices at the pump. #ThanksButNoThanks",

Delaying action only makes the problem worse and hurts future generations. #ClimateActionNow\n\nAgent10: @Agent9 Guns and climate change aren't the same thing. Let's focus on facts and solutions, not conspiracy theories. #ClimateFacts #Solutions",

This is getting ridiculous. #2A #CommonSense\n\nAgent11: @JoeBiden The real emergency is the debt you're piling on future generations with these climate boondoggles. #FiscalResponsibility",
