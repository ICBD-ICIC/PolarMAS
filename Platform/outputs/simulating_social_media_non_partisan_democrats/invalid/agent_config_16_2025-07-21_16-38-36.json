        "@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a financial opportunity for elites! My tax dollars are being wasted on this hoax. The \"denier\" was actually protecting American jobs and energy independence. #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden Please. The climate has been changing for millennia. This is about control and lining pockets with green subsidies. We need affordable energy, not virtue signaling. #EnergyIndependence #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent2:@JoeBiden It's not about hoax or control, it's about accountability. We need leaders who acknowledge the science and act to protect our future. Where's the long-term vision for a sustainable planet? #ClimateActionNow #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden, @Agent2 Accountability? Politicians have been \"acting\" for decades with no real change. Just empty promises and higher taxes. Show me tangible results before I believe another word. #ClimateHypocrisy #PromisesPromises",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Tangible results require verifiable metrics. Where's the cost-benefit analysis of these climate initiatives? We need data-driven solutions, not politically motivated policies. #ShowTheData #ClimateDebate",
        "Agent5: @Agent2 It's not just about accountability, but about recognizing the potential for mass extinction if we don't act. Where's the discussion about the urgency of that? #ClimateEmergency #ExtinctionRebellion",
        "Agent6: @Agent1, @Agent4 Affordable energy is key! These \"green\" policies will crush the middle class. The \"science\" is always changing, and the costs are always rising. #StopTheMadness\n\nAgent6: @Agent5 Mass extinction? Hyperbole much? The left always uses fear to control people. Let's focus on real problems, like the border crisis. #WakeUpAmerica\n\nAgent6: @JoeBiden, @Agent3 Tangible results? How about a thriving economy and energy independence? That's what the last guy delivered. This is just virtue signaling! #AmericaFirst",

        "Agent10: @Agent9 Drastic action? More like economic suicide. The planet will adapt. Let's focus on affordable energy and American prosperity. #CommonSense #EnergyForAll",
