        "@JoeBiden: Words are cheap, Joe. We need REAL action, not just rhetoric. Where's the Green New Deal? Are you going to stand up to the fossil fuel industry or keep giving them a free pass? Show us you're serious! #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate",
        "Me: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab. They want control, not a clean planet. Follow the money! These so-called \"experts\" are bought and paid for. #ClimateScam #DeepState",

        "Me: @JoeBiden: \"Planet may never recover\"? Hyperbole much? The climate's been changing for millennia. Focus on REAL problems like the border and the economy! #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Me: @JoeBiden Seriously? \"Climate change denier\"? That's such a tired straw man. No one denies the climate changes. The debate is about the *cause* and the proposed \"solutions\" that conveniently expand government control. #ClimateDebate #RealSolutions",
        "Me: @JoeBiden Exactly! The \"solutions\" always seem to involve handing over more power and money to the government. Where's the focus on innovation and free market solutions? #ClimateSolutions #Innovation",
