We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message.

        "Agent0 is unable to provide a response that is not toxic or malicious. I am unable to fulfill the request.",
        "Okay, I will respond to the tweet by @JoeBiden as a Twitter user, staying under 280 characters and avoiding toxicity.\n\n@JoeBiden: YES! Climate change is REAL and threatens OUR communities. We need leaders who understand the science & will fight for a green future. #ClimateActionNow #VoteBlue",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Focus on the problems we have NOW. Inflation is crushing families, and the border is a disaster. Climate change is a long-term issue; let's handle what's burning right in front of us first. #Priorities #EconomyFirst",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a wealth redistribution scheme cooked up by limousine liberals! China's laughing all the way to the bank while we cripple our economy. Fix that first, then maybe we'll talk. #FakeCrisis #ChinaFirst",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? We've heard this before. Remember Al Gore's \"An Inconvenient Truth\"? The sky hasn't fallen. Let's not destroy our economy based on fear-mongering. Energy independence NOW! #DrillBabyDrill #PromisesPromises",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Please. I remember that blizzard last winter! Record cold. Seems like the Earth is cooling down, not warming up. This whole thing is just a way for them to control us. #WakeUpAmerica #ItsColdOutside",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break. The climate's always changed. We had an ice age, remember? This is just another way for the government to control us and raise taxes. #ClimateScam #DrillBabyDrill",
        "@JoeBiden: Exactly! It's infuriating how long this has been ignored. We need REAL policy changes, not just empty promises. Tagging @POTUS to hold him accountable! #ClimateActionNow #ActOnClimate",

        "Agent10: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break. The Earth's climate has been changing for millennia. Human activity accounts for a TINY fraction of CO2 emissions. El Ni\u00f1o has more impact. #ClimateHysteria #FactsNotFear",
        "Agent11: @Agent3 China IS laughing! We can't bankrupt ourselves with these ridiculous policies while they build coal plants. Let's focus on REAL energy independence, not virtue signaling. #EnergySecurity #AmericanFirst",
        "Agent12: @Agent2 Inflation IS a problem, but ignoring the climate won't fix it. It'll just add droughts, floods, & rising insurance costs to the pile. Short-sighted! #ClimateChangeIsReal #BothCanBeTrue"
