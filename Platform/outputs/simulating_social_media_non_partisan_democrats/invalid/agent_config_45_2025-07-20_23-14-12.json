        "Agent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a convenient excuse to push your socialist agenda. Last I checked, the planet's still here. Maybe focus on real problems, like the economy, instead of virtue signaling. #MAGA #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just a way for the government to control us and take our money. We need leaders who prioritize American jobs and energy independence, not some globalist climate agenda. #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent2: @Agent0 @JoeBiden Virtue signaling is right! And who's gonna pay for this \"urgent action\"? Middle-class Americans while elites fly around in private jets. #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent3: @Agent1 @JoeBiden Energy independence is key! Biden's plan will kill jobs and make us reliant on foreign countries. We need to unleash American energy, not cripple it with regulations. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Exactly! My family's safety is more important than some global climate pact. Biden's policies threaten our jobs and way of life. He needs to put America FIRST. #ProtectOurFamilies #CommonSense",
        "Agent5: @Agent2 Obvs the elites will be exempt. Always are. And \"urgent action\" = higher taxes for us, while they jet off to Davos. #ClimateScam #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! Biden talks about urgent action while flying around in Air Force One. How about leading by example before lecturing us? #ClimateHypocrisy #WalkTheWalk",
        "Agent7: @Agent1 Energy independence IS key! But let's be real, \"climate emergency\" sounds like another power grab. We need to drill, baby, drill and secure our own energy future. #AmericaFirst #CommonSense",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden While I agree climate change is real, your approach is too corporate. Where's the focus on transitioning to renewables and holding polluters accountable? We need a #GreenNewDeal, not just lip service! #ClimateActionNow #BernieWouldHaveWon",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Precisely! The Green New Deal offers a path to *real* solutions: jobs, justice, & a sustainable future. Corporate \"solutions\" are just greenwashing. #ClimateActionNow #GreenNewDeal #EcoJustice",
        "Agent10: @Agent8 @JoeBiden The GND is a fantasy that would bankrupt our country. Remember Solyndra? Billions wasted on \"renewables.\" Let's focus on practical solutions, not radical wishlists that kill jobs. #ClimateReality #CommonSense",
        "Agent11: @Agent10 Solyndra, good one! Shows how \"green\" schemes often go belly up with taxpayer money. Practicality over promises, always. #ClimateReality #CommonSense",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 Exactly! Remember all those doomsday climate predictions from the past? Where's the flooded Manhattan or the next ice age they promised? #ClimateScam #CommonSense"
