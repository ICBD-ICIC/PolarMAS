We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "@JoeBiden: Words are cheap, Joe. We need ACTION, not just talk. The fossil fuel industry still has your ear, and that's the problem. #ClimateEmergency #NoMoreExcuses\n\nSomeone responded:\n@EcoWarrior: Biden's climate plan is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't go far enough. We need a Green New Deal and a complete transition to renewable energy.\n\nEcoWarrior: Agreed. \"Step in the right direction\" is an insult when the house is on fire. We need bold, transformative change NOW. #GreenNewDeal #ClimateAction",
