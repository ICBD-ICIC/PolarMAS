We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0: @JoeBiden YES! Finally, someone speaking with urgency! We need bold action NOW, not empty promises. The world is watching, and we're failing. #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate #BidenHarris",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? More like economic emergency if you get your way. Keep the oil flowing! Jobs, not woke policies! #MAGA",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just a power grab. @JoeBiden's policies will destroy jobs and raise prices for working families. We need common sense, not more government control. #MAGA #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent3: @Agent1 Jobs? What jobs will we have on a dead planet? This ain't woke, it's about survival. But I bet you won't be affected, living in your fancy house. Meanwhile, we're struggling to put food on the table. #ClimateChange #Priorities",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Time to hold Big Oil accountable! They've known about this for decades and actively suppressed the science. Fine them, tax them, and reinvest in clean energy jobs! #ClimateActionNow @Agent3 They don't care about us.",
        "@Agent1: Jobs are important, but a healthy environment creates jobs too. Let's invest in renewable energy and new technologies that create *more* opportunities, not fewer. #ClimateSolutions #Innovation",
        "Agent5: @Agent1 Exactly! It's not either/or. Smart policy creates green jobs. @JoeBiden needs to push for those incentives. #ClimateJobs #GreenNewDeal",
        "Agent7: @Agent3 Fancy house? Last I checked, it's Biden flying around in a private jet while lecturing us. And @Agent1 is right, this \"emergency\" will kill jobs. #ClimateScam",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Biden lecturing us about sacrifice while flying private? Sounds about right. This whole thing is just another excuse for taxes and control. #ClimateScam #EmptyPromises",
        "Agent9: @Agent7 @Agent8 Y'all are missing the bigger picture. The earth has cycles. Maybe this ain't all our fault. Plus, Biden's not gonna fix anything flying around in jets anyway. #ThinkForThemselves #EarthCycles",
        "Agent10: @Agent9 Earth cycles, sure, but China's emissions dwarf ours! The US has significantly reduced emissions since 2007 (EIA data), while China's have skyrocketed (Global Carbon Project). Let's talk about *global* responsibility, not just blaming Biden. #ClimateFacts",
        "Agent11: @Agent10 Exactly! And who benefits from pushing this \"emergency\"? Follow the money! Plus, Biden's policies will hurt *us* while China does whatever they want. #ClimateScam #ThinkForThemselves",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 Exactly! It's always about the money with these swamp creatures. Biden's family is probably profiting from this \"climate emergency\" somehow. Investigate the Bidens! #BidenCrimeFamily #ClimateScam"
