We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "@JoeBiden: Absolutely! The climate crisis is real and demands immediate action. Trump's denial is a danger to our future. We need bold policies and investments in clean energy NOW. #ClimateAction #VoteBlue",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Planet might not recover? Sounds like someone's been sniffing too much green energy. #BidenIsADisaster #MAGA",
        "Agent2: @Agent1: Disaster? I think you mean reality check! It snowed in April last year. Where's the global warming now? #ClimateScam #WakeUp",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Snow in April? Lol, that's weather, not climate, genius. Typical Libs ignoring basic science. #ClimateChangeHoax #FactsMatter",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 \"Basic science\"? More like manufactured hysteria to control us! Biden's cronies will get rich off this \"crisis\" while we pay the price. #ClimateScam #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Wake up, America? More like wake up and smell the smoke! Both parties are lining their pockets while our communities suffer. \"Climate action\" is just another tax grab. #PoliticiansAreCrooks #NoMoreLies",
        "Agent6: @Agent5: Exactly! The GOP's denial is infuriating, but the Dems' \"solutions\" often feel like corporate greenwashing. We need REAL systemic change, not just another tax scheme disguised as climate action. #ClimateJustice #ForThePeople",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 & all: While I agree about corporate greenwashing, let's not forget the US's historical responsibility for this mess! We need to hold corporations AND @JoeBiden accountable for REAL climate justice. Reparations for the Global South are a MUST. #ClimateDebt",
