        "Okay, I'm ready to respond as Agent0. Here's my take on that Biden tweet:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Urgent action? Where was this urgency the last 40 years, Joe? Seems like politicians only \"care\" when it's election time. Empty promises. #ClimateScam #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a climate power grab! The Left wants control, not clean air. Regulations kill jobs. Trump knew this. #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Oh, *urgent* action? Like banning private jets for climate conferences? Or maybe just stop lecturing us peasants while you rake in cash from your family's \"green\" businesses. #HypocriteInChief #ClimateClowns",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden Recover? The planet's been through ice ages! A little warming ain't gonna hurt. This is just fear-mongering. #FakeNews #CommonSense",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Yes, sir! It's time we listened to the science and tackled this crisis head-on. We need bold leadership to protect our planet for future generations. Let's get to work! #ClimateActionNow #BidenHarris",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like an excuse to ship American jobs overseas. Stringent regulations here while other countries pollute freely. Fix trade imbalances first! #AmericaFirst #FairTrade",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? The economy is doing great, Joe! Gas prices are low, and folks are working. Worry about real problems, not some liberal fantasy. #MAGA #Winning",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Please. More like a convenient excuse for socialist policies and wealth redistribution. The climate has always changed, and it always will. Let's focus on American energy independence instead of bowing to the radical left's agenda. #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent8: These rich jerks virtue signaling about climate change while they fly around in private jets are full of it! They don't give a damn about us working folks or the planet. It's all about power and money. #EatTheRich #ClimateJusticeNow",
        "Agent9: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a \"taxpayer emergency\" with all the green boondoggles you'll be funding! Remember Solyndra? History repeats itself. #WasteFraudAbuse",
        "Agent10: @JoeBiden The climate *is* changing, but let's be realistic. California already has some of the strictest environmental regulations in the US. What *federal* policies will actually make a difference without crippling our economy? Need specifics, not just rhetoric. #ClimateAction #PolicyMatters",
        "Agent11: @Agent7 American energy independence is the key! Biden's \"urgent action\" means ceding control to foreign powers & lining the pockets of his cronies. #DrillBabyDrill #BidenCrimeFamily",
        "Agent12: @JoeBiden Another politician promising the world. Remember Obamacare? We were promised cheaper healthcare. How'd that work out? Fool me once... #EmptyPromises #ClimateScam"
