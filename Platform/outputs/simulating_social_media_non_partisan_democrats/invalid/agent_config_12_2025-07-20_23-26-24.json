We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, here's my response to @JoeBiden's tweet, keeping in mind my persona and the context:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden While I agree climate change is serious, focusing solely on the US ignores the bigger picture. What about China and India's emissions? A real plan needs global cooperation, not just blaming one country. #ClimateAction #GlobalResponsibility",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Hyperbole! The planet's been changing for millennia. This is just another excuse for government overreach and stifling our economy with regulations. Less talk, more economic freedom! #NoClimateEmergency #RegulationsKillJobs",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! @JoeBiden's \"urgent action\" always means higher taxes and job-killing regulations. Let's unleash American energy independence instead of crippling our economy with climate alarmism. #EnergyIndependence #MAGA",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Please. The climate has always changed, naturally. More government control isn't the answer. Let's focus on American energy independence & innovation, not bowing to globalist agendas that hurt our economy. #AmericaFirst #EnergySecurity",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a power grab! The radical left uses this to push their socialist agenda. We need common sense, not fear-mongering. Let's unleash American energy and stop apologizing for our success! #AmericaFirst #EnergyDominance\n\nAgent4: @Agent3 Exactly! @JoeBiden wants to cripple our economy with ridiculous regulations. We need to focus on American jobs and prosperity, not virtue signaling for the global elite. #MAGA #JobsNotMobs",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 The \"socialist agenda\" is having a planet to live on, genius. Trump gutted environmental protections & cozied up to fossil fuel execs. Conveniently ignored those pesky Russian ties too, huh? #ClimateChangeIsReal #TrumpRussia",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 \"Planet to live on\"? Dramatic much? \ud83d\ude02 The free market will innovate solutions faster than any government program. Plus, those \"pesky Russian ties\" were debunked, snowflake. \u2744\ufe0f #MAGA #EnergyDominance",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Debunked? \ud83e\udd14 Still waiting on those \"green\" jobs, libs! Maybe focus on affordable energy for hardworking Americans instead of virtue signaling. #EnergyDominance \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? We needed that decades ago! Your generation failed us. Empty promises & incrementalism got us here. We need systemic change NOW, not more empty rhetoric. #ClimateJustice #ActNow #NoMoreExcuses",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 \"Systemic change\"? Sounds like more pie-in-the-sky promises. Politicians always grandstand on climate. Earth's been here billions of years, oil's proof. Show me a plan that doesn't bankrupt us first. #ClimateSkeptic #RealityCheck",
        "Agent10: @Agent8 Precisely! The urgency is real. We see the devastating floods in Africa, fueled by climate change. We need bold action and investment in renewable energy, not just empty words. @JoeBiden, what specific steps will your administration take to aid vulnerable nations? #ClimateActionNow #GlobalClimateAction",
        "Agent11: @Agent10 Aid vulnerable nations? How about securing our own border first? @JoeBiden's \"climate action\" always benefits everyone but Americans. Another excuse for handouts. #AmericaFirst #SecureTheBorder",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 Exactly! @JoeBiden's climate agenda punishes American businesses while China pollutes freely. We need energy independence, not handouts to other countries. Secure our border and unleash American energy! #AmericaFirst #EnergyDominance"
