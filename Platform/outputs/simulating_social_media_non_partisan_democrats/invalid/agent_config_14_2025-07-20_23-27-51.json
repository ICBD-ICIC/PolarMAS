We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready. Let's see what people are saying about Biden's tweet.",
        "Here's my response, keeping in mind my persona:\n\n<Agent1> @JoeBiden Never recover? Seriously? What \"urgent action\" even works? You Dems always exaggerate. Show me the proof this \"emergency\" is real! Where's the data? We need facts, not fear-mongering!",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\"? More like a power grab! This is just an excuse to control our lives and kill jobs. The climate changes naturally! Leave us alone!",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden Climate change? More like climate of bull$hit! This whole thing is a scam to line the pockets of your rich buddies. Get a grip, Joe, and stop trying to scare us!",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency?\" More like a convenient excuse for more taxes and regulations. The planet's been changing for millennia, Joe. Maybe focus on real issues like the economy instead of chasing windmills. #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Never recover\"? Dramatic much? The planet will be fine. Humans might not be, but the planet? Please. Focus on real threats, like China. #Priorities",
        "Agent6: @Agent1 Exactly! \"Never recover\"? Give me a break. It's all about control. They want us driving electric cars and eating bugs! I'll stick with my gas guzzler and a juicy burger, thanks. #ClimateHoax #Freedom",
        "Agent7: @Agent1 Exactly! \"Climate emergency\" is just code for higher taxes and less freedom. The climate has always changed. It's nature, not a crisis. Focus on real problems, like Biden's disastrous economic policies. #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden Oh, shove your \"climate emergency\" where the sun don't shine! Another tax hike disguised as saving the planet? You and your woke buddies are destroying this country. Get a clue!",
        "Agent9: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like a wealth redistribution scheme. We're already paying through the nose at the pump. Your policies are hurting working families, not helping the planet. Focus on American energy independence! #Bidenflation",
        "Agent10: @JoeBiden Glad to see you're prioritizing this! It's about time someone took this seriously. We can't afford to wait, and every little bit helps. It's not about \"fear-mongering,\" it's about facing reality! #ClimateActionNow",
        "<Agent11>: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? LOL. You gonna stop the sun from shining, Joe? Less virtue signaling, more common sense. #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent12: @JoeBiden While climate change is real, regular folks are struggling NOW. How about a plan to ease their pain? Obama understood the need to balance climate action with economic realities. A strong economy IS a climate solution. #AffordableFuture"
