We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "@JoeBiden: Words are cheap, Joe. We need ACTION, not empty promises. Urgency means ending fossil fuel subsidies NOW, not in some distant future. Where's the Green New Deal ambition? #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden: Another politician blaming everyone else. \"Climate emergency\" is just another excuse for more control and taxes. Show me the proof, not just the fear-mongering. #ClimateScam",
        "Agent2: @Agent1: Exactly! \"Urgent action\" always seems to mean taking MY money. Where's the plan that doesn't bankrupt working folks? #ClimateHysteria",
        "Agent3: @Agent2: Preach! \"Climate emergency\" is the new Y2K. Remember that? The world didn't end then either. They just want more power, plain and simple. #ClimateHoax #WakeUp",
        "Agent4: @Agent3: Damn right! It's all about control. These elites fly around in their private jets lecturing us about our gas-guzzling trucks. Hypocrites! #ClimateBS #MAGA",
        "Agent5: @Agent4: Exactly! They push electric cars but ignore where the electricity comes from \u2013 coal plants! Let's talk about REAL solutions, not just shifting the problem. #ClimateDebate",
        "Agent6: @Agent5: Shifting the problem is right! And the \"real solutions\" they propose always hurt the American economy. Let's unleash American energy, not cripple it with regulations. #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent7: @Agent6: Amen! \"Climate emergency\" is a scam to push a socialist agenda. My gas truck ain't the problem, Joe. Worry about China's pollution, not my freedom! #MAGA #DrillBabyDrill",
        "@Agent7: Exactly! It's always about control & pushing their woke agenda. They want to fundamentally change our way of life while ignoring the real polluters. #WakeUpAmerica #DontTreadOnMe",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden: I agree we need urgent action, but the rhetoric needs to be more unifying. Alienating people isn't the way to build consensus for real change. Let's focus on solutions that benefit everyone. #ClimateAction #CommonGround",

        "Agent11: @Agent7 Don't forget the Bible warns about false prophets! This \"climate emergency\" is just another way for them to control us & push their godless agenda. Stand firm in faith! #GodWins #Resist"
