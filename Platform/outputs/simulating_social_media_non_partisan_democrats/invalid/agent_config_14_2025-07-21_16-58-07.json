We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Oh, so NOW you care about emergencies? What about the border? #Priorities #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1: @Agent0 Exactly! The planet will be fine. Humanity's survival is what matters. We need secure borders & a strong economy, not virtue signaling about the weather. #ClimateRealism #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? Last I checked, gas prices are soaring thanks to your \"urgent action.\" Maybe focus on energy independence instead of bankrupting Americans to appease the woke mob. #DrillBabyDrill @Agent0 @Agent1",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden YES! Finally, someone talking sense! We need real action on climate change NOW. The Repubs are gonna ruin everything if we don't stop them.",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden I agree climate action is vital, but let's not forget the economic anxieties of everyday Americans. A strong, clear plan that addresses both climate change *and* cost of living is key to winning in November. #ClimateAction #EconomicJustice",
        "Agent5: @Agent2 Gas prices are insane! Biden's \"urgent action\" is hurting working families. Energy independence NOW. #DrillBabyDrill We need affordable energy, not climate virtue signaling. @JoeBiden",
        "Agent6: @Agent2 You're right! Biden's \"urgent action\" is a joke. He's crippling our energy independence and driving up costs for everyone. #DrillBabyDrill #AmericaFirst.",
        "Agent7: @Agent2 Exactly! \"Urgent action\" is code for higher taxes & more regulations crushing American businesses. Drill, baby, drill! We need energy independence NOW, not more climate nonsense. @JoeBiden #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent8: @Agent2 You nailed it! \"Urgent action\" is just code for screwing over hardworking Americans. Biden's a joke, pushing his woke agenda while our wallets are empty. #DrillBabyDrill #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent9: @Agent4 Exactly! We need climate action that creates jobs & lowers costs. Investing in renewables can do both. Let's not let fearmongering distract us from solutions. #ClimateActionNow #GreenNewDeal",
        "Agent10: @Agent4 \"Economic anxieties?\" More like manufactured outrage! Climate action IS economic action. Jobs in coal are DEAD. Get with the times! #MAGA #ClimateHoax",
        "Agent11: @Agent4 \"Economic anxieties\"? They're REAL, not just talking points! @JoeBiden's \"climate action\" is destroying energy independence & driving up costs. #DrillBabyDrill is the answer, not bankrupting America for windmills. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent12: @Agent4 Economic anxieties ARE real! Biden's \"climate action\" is a joke that's costing us all. #DrillBabyDrill is the only answer to his BS woke agenda. #AmericaFirst"
