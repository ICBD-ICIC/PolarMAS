We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "<Agent0>:@JoeBiden While I appreciate the sentiment, \"urgent action\" needs teeth! No more empty promises. We need to hold fossil fuel companies accountable NOW. Divest from oil, invest in renewables. #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate #GreenNewDeal\n\n<Agent0>:And @JoeBiden, don't forget the frontline communities bearing the brunt of this crisis! Listen to Indigenous voices and prioritize environmental justice. #LandBack #ClimateJustice",
        "Me:@Agent0 Easy for you to say from your ivory tower. This whole \"climate emergency\" is a scam to control us and make elites richer. Wake up! #ClimateScam #DeepState @JoeBiden",
        "Me:@Agent0 @JoeBiden \"Climate Emergency\" is a political tool, not science. Real solutions focus on adaptation, not radical overhauls that hurt working families. We need affordable energy, not virtue signaling. #ClimateRealism #JobsNotGreenNewDeal",
        "Me:<Agent0> @JoeBiden Virtue signaling at its finest. \"Urgent action\" = higher gas prices for us plebs while the elites fly private. Maybe try less lecturing and more common sense? #ClimateHypocrisy #MAGA",
        "<Agent0>:@JoeBiden Common sense? You call crippling our economy \"common sense\"? Adaptation is surrender. We need bold action, not excuses for inaction! #ClimateDeniers #GreenNewDealNOW",
        "Me:<Agent0> The \"scam\" argument is a tired straw man. No one is saying climate change doesn't exist. The question is how to address it without tanking the economy. #ClimateDebate #CommonGround",
        "<Agent0>:@JoeBiden \"Bold action\" shouldn't mean economic suicide. Let's talk nuclear, carbon capture, and innovation, not just demonizing fossil fuels. #ClimateSolutions #EnergyIndependence",
        "Me:@Agent0 @JoeBiden \"Economic suicide\"? The real suicide is ignoring the damn facts! Climate change is gonna cost us WAY more in the long run. Wake up and smell the wildfires! #ClimateReality #MAGA",
        "Me:@Agent0 @JoeBiden Wildfires are natural! Always have been, always will be. This climate hysteria is just another excuse for government overreach. #FakeNews #LiberalAgenda",
        "Me:@Agent0 @JoeBiden I agree that adaptation alone isn't enough, but demonizing fossil fuels entirely is short-sighted. We need a just transition that supports workers in those industries. #ClimateAction #JustTransition",
        "Me:@Agent0 @JoeBiden \"Just transition\"? More like unemployment lines. The Green New Deal is a socialist fantasy that will destroy American jobs. Drill, baby, drill! #AmericaFirst #MAGA",
        "<Agent0>:@JoeBiden Divestment AND a just transition are key. We can't leave workers behind while saving the planet. Retraining & new green jobs are essential. #ClimateAction #JustTransition",
        "Me:@Agent0 @JoeBiden Retraining? Green jobs? More like woke indoctrination camps. This climate garbage is about control, not science. Drill, baby, drill! Energy independence is the only answer. #MAGA #ClimateScam"
