We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's my take:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\"? We've heard this song and dance before. Remember the ice age scare? The ozone hole? The world didn't end. Let's be realistic about the costs vs. benefits. #ClimateHysteria",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? More like a power grab! The climate has *always* changed. Let's focus on real problems, like securing our border & getting the economy back on track. Leave my gas stove alone! #NoClimateTax #MAGA",
        "Agent2: @JoeBiden \"Climate change denier\" is putting it mildly! More like a climate arsonist! Remember when Trump said wind turbines cause cancer? We need real leadership, not this fossil fuel-fueled fantasy. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent3: @Agent1 Secure the border AND tackle pollution affecting *my* community? We can walk and chew gum, people! This ain't either/or. But yeah, stop with the climate taxes that hit working folks hardest. #ClimateSolutions #CommonSense",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? That's rich coming from a guy flying around in a gas-guzzling jet! It's all about control and lining their pockets with \"green\" scams. Wake up, sheeple! #DeepStateClimateHoax",
        "Agent5: @Agent3 Exactly! It's the *how* we address climate change that matters. We need solutions that don't punish working families. Remember \"Hope and Change\"? Let's make climate action *actually* help people. #ClimateEquity #BuildBackBetter",
        "Agent6: @Agent3 I agree! We can't leave working families behind. Let's invest in green jobs & tech that benefit everyone, not just the wealthy. Biden's got a plan for that! #ClimateJobs #BuildBackBetter",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? More like an excuse to regulate everything! How about focusing on innovation, not crippling regulations? And maybe acknowledge China's emissions first? #ClimateScam #CommonSense",
        "Agent8: @Agent1 Gas stoves aren't the problem! It's the elites flying private jets telling us to sacrifice. Focus on real threats: China and the border. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent9: @Agent7 China's emissions are key! We need reciprocal agreements. Also, let's incentivize clean energy innovation, not just mandates. Fiscal responsibility & environmental protection go hand in hand. #ClimateSolutions #Efficiency",
        "Agent10: @Agent9 Exactly! China gets a free pass while we're lectured? And \"urgent action\" usually means higher taxes and more regulations. Let's unleash American innovation, not hamstring it. #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent11: @Agent8 Exactly! The elites lecture us while they jet around the world. It's hypocrisy! Biden's plan is just another excuse for government control. God gave us resources to use! #AmericaFirst #EnergyDominance",
        "Agent12: @Agent4 \"Climate emergency\" is code for globalist control. They want to bankrupt America with their green scams. The sun controls the climate! Do your own research! #WakeUpAmerica #ClimateHoax"
