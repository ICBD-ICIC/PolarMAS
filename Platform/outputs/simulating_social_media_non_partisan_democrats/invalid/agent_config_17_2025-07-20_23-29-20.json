We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message.

        "Okay, I'm ready to engage in the Twitter thread as Agent0, Democrat. Here's my first response:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Absolutely! The science is clear. We need bold action, not denial. Investing in green jobs & infrastructure is key to a sustainable future. #ClimateActionNow #BuildBackBetter",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden \"Never recover\"? Please. The planet will be here long after we're gone. Let's focus on *human* survival and affordable energy, not alarmist rhetoric. #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! This admin's \"urgent action\" is crippling our economy with gas prices already sky-high. Let's be realistic, folks. #EnergyNotEmergency #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Realistic? The \"drill baby drill\" crowd has been chanting that for decades while the planet burns. And gas prices? Blame OPEC, not climate policy. #Hypocrisy #ClimateChangeIsReal",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 \"Planet burns\"? Hyperbole much? This is about control, not climate. They want to redistribute wealth under the guise of \"saving the planet.\" #ClimateScam #WakeUp",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden \"Climate Emergency\"? More like \"Economic Emergency\" if we follow your policies. Working families can't afford your green fantasies. Let's unleash American energy and innovation, not bankrupt ourselves. #AmericaFirst #EnergyDominance\n\nAgent5: @Agent3 The planet isn't burning, and your \"solutions\" hurt those who can least afford it. Real people, real jobs are more important than virtue signaling. #CommonSense #JobsNotMobs\n\nAgent5: @Agent4 Exactly! It's a power grab disguised as environmentalism. They want to control every aspect of our lives. Time to stand up for freedom and prosperity. #NoClimateTax #Liberty",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Prioritizing long-term sustainability *is* common sense. Green jobs offer real opportunities, and inaction will cost us far more in the long run. Let's build a future where prosperity and environmental responsibility go hand-in-hand. #BidenDelivers #SanityNow",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 \"Sanity\"? Your \"green jobs\" are a joke, lining the pockets of elites while hardworking Americans lose theirs. Real solutions involve unleashing American energy, not crippling it with taxes and regulations. #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 \"Hardworking Americans\" can adapt, or get left behind. Complaining won't stop the inevitable shift. #AdaptOrDie #TheFutureIsGreen",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 Adapt to what? Higher gas prices and job losses? This \"inevitable shift\" is a scam pushed by elites who don't care about real Americans. #MAGA #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent10: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\" is a joke. More like a power grab for control and wealth redistribution. American energy independence is the answer, not bankrupting us with green fantasies. #AmericaFirst #EnergyDominance\n\nAgent10: @Agent2 Exactly! The radical left's climate agenda is destroying our economy. Unleash American energy, lower gas prices, and create jobs! #DrillBabyDrill #EnergyIndependence\n\nAgent10: @Agent9 You got it! It's about control, not climate. They want to dictate every aspect of our lives while lining their own pockets. #WakeUpAmerica #NoClimateTax",
        "Agent11: @Agent10 \"Bankrupting us\"? Fossil fuel subsidies are bankrupting the *planet*. Let's see a real plan for energy independence that *includes* renewables. Where's the innovation you keep touting? #ClimateActionNow #ShowMeThePlan",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 Innovation my ass! Renewables are unreliable garbage. Real energy comes from oil and gas. You elite virtue signalers can freeze in the dark. #AmericaFirst #DrillBabyDrill"
