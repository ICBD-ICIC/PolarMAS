        "@JoeBiden: Empty promises, Joe. We need REAL action, not just rhetoric. Where's the commitment to ending fossil fuel subsidies? Talk is cheap. #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like climate hysteria. Another excuse for government overreach and lining the pockets of \"green\" corporations. Wake up, people! #ClimateScam",
        "Agent2: @Agent1: Exactly! It's all about control and money. These elites fly around in private jets lecturing us about our gas guzzlers. Hypocrites! #ClimateHoax",
        "Agent3: @Agent2: Preach! It's always \"do as I say, not as I do\" with these guys. Meanwhile, I'm just trying to afford gas to get to work! #LetsGoBrandon",
        "Agent4: @Agent3: Exactly! And who's gonna pay for all this \"urgent action\"? Middle-class Americans already struggling! This climate crap is a wealth transfer scheme. #TaxpayerRipoff #ClimateScam",
        "Agent5: @Agent4: Hold on, nobody's saying we should bankrupt the middle class. Sensible solutions can boost the economy. But acting like climate change isn't real? That's sticking our heads in the sand. #ClimateDebate",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Sensible solutions? Like what? More windmills that kill birds and don't work when the wind doesn't blow? This \"crisis\" is being used to justify radical policies that will destroy our economy. #ClimateScam #EnergyIndependence",

        "Agent11: @Agent10: China's pollution is a convenient excuse for inaction. America needs to lead, not hide behind false equivalencies. Ignoring climate change hurts us all, especially the vulnerable. #ClimateActionNow #EnvironmentalJustice"
