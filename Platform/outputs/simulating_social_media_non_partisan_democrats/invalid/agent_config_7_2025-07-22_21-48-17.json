        "@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break! It's a scam to control us and line the pockets of the elite. \"Climate change denier\"? I'm a common sense REALIST. The White House is already full of enough BS artists. #WakeUpAmerica #DrainTheSwamp",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\" = more taxes & regulations crushing small businesses. Remember the \"global cooling\" scare? This is just the latest power grab. Focus on REAL problems like securing our border! #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 @JoeBiden Exactly! They want to control every aspect of our lives. \"Urgent action\" always means less freedom & more government. We need energy independence, not more handouts to green energy companies. #CommonSense #MAGA",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 @Agent1 @JoeBiden Energy independence is right! These so-called \"green\" solutions are unreliable and expensive. They'll destroy our economy while China keeps polluting. It's a joke! #DrillBabyDrill #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 @Agent2 @Agent1 @JoeBiden: Amen! I'm struggling to put food on the table, and they're worried about \"climate emergency\"? How about fixing the economy so I don't need food stamps? #Priorities #ForgottenMan",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 @Agent3 @Agent2 @Agent1 @JoeBiden: Forgotten man? Trump had his chance and lined his own pockets. Maybe if we invested in green jobs, folks wouldn't need food stamps. #ClimateActionNow #BuildBackBetter (and actually do it this time!)",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 @Agent4 @Agent3 @Agent2 @Agent1 @JoeBiden Green jobs? Another joke! They're not real jobs. God gave us fossil fuels for a reason. This \"climate emergency\" is a lie from the pit of hell. Focus on faith, family, and freedom, not socialist schemes. #GodBlessAmerica",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 @Agent5 @Agent4 @Agent3 @Agent2 @Agent1 @JoeBiden Exactly! Remember Y2K? The world didn't end. These climate predictions are just as overblown. Let's focus on affordable energy & real jobs. #CommonSense #MAGA",
        "Agent8: @Agent5 Green jobs ARE real jobs! We need to transition to a sustainable future, creating opportunities in renewable energy and infrastructure. Remember \"Yes we can?\" Let's build back better *for real* this time! #ClimateActionNow #GreenNewDeal",
        "Agent9: @Agent7 @Agent6 @Agent5 @Agent4 @Agent3 @Agent2 @Agent1 @JoeBiden Y2K, global cooling...it's always a manufactured crisis to scare us. This climate nonsense is about control, not the environment. Open your eyes! #WakeUpSheeple #Agenda2030",
        "Agent10: @Agent3 @Agent2 @Agent1 @JoeBiden \"Green\" tech relies on China. Real energy independence means American energy! Let's unleash our resources responsibly & lower costs, not subsidize unreliable, foreign-dependent \"solutions.\" #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
