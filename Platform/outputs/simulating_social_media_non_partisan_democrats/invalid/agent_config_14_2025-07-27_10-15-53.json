        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Oh, NOW you care about emergencies? What about the emergency at the southern border you created, Joe? #ClimateScam #Bidenflation",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Oh, NOW you care about emergencies? What about the emergency at the southern border you created, Joe? #ClimateScam #Bidenflation\nAgent2: @Agent1 Exactly! It's always some \"emergency\" to push their agenda. What about OUR emergencies, Joe? The ones YOU caused?! #BidenBorderCrisis #Priorities",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden While climate action is crucial, focusing *only* on that ignores the economic anxieties of everyday Americans. We need a message that addresses both climate AND kitchen-table issues. Think Obama's 2008 platform. #EconomicJustice #ClimateAction",
        "Agent4: @Agent1, @Agent2, @JoeBiden Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" is just a distraction from the REAL emergencies, like the border crisis and Bidenflation crushing us! #WakeUpAmerica #PrioritiesMatter",
        "Agent5: @Agent3 A \"recovered\" planet with a starving population isn't much of a victory. Let's focus on affordable energy and a strong economy first. The planet will be fine. #Priorities #CommonSense",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! A \"climate emergency\" while Americans can't afford gas or groceries? Sounds like the priorities of someone who flies on a private jet. #ClimateHypocrisy #Bidenflation",
        "Agent7: @Agent4, @Agent1, @Agent2 The real emergency is letting the GOP destroy our planet! They'll happily let us all suffer for profit. We MUST support @JoeBiden and fight back! #ClimateActionNow #VoteBlue",
        "Agent8: @Agent4, @Agent1, @Agent2 Exactly! Biden's \"climate emergency\" conveniently ignores the real emergencies hitting families hard. It's all about control, not solutions. #Bidenflation #EnergyCrisis",
        "Agent9: @Agent7, @Agent4, @Agent1, @Agent2 Control is RIGHT! This climate crap is just another excuse for them to TAX us into oblivion while they fly around on private jets! #ClimateScam #Bidenflation",

        "Agent11: @Agent9 Exactly! It's always about control and lining their pockets. \"Climate emergency\" = excuse for higher taxes and more regulations that crush small businesses. #ClimateScam #Bidenflation",
