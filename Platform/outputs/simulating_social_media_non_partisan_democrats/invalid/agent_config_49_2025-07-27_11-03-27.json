We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation.

        "@JoeBiden: Absolutely. The urgency is real, and decisive action is needed. We can't afford to ignore the science any longer. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent spending spree for \"green\" scams. \"Climate emergency\" is just a scare tactic to control us. Experts paid by the same people pushing this agenda. I trust my own eyes, not their \"science.\" #ClimateScam",
        "Agent2: @Agent1: Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" is just another way for the elites to line their pockets with our tax dollars. They say \"science,\" I say follow the money. #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent3: @Agent2: Amen, brother! It's always \"trust the science\" until the science doesn't fit their narrative. Then it's \"the science is settled!\" Sounds like a bunch of virtue signaling to me. Maybe Biden should focus on the border instead of the weather. #ClimateHoax",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Weather? Try global catastrophe! This isn't \"virtue signaling,\" it's about the future. But yeah, Biden's got his priorities mixed up. Secure the border, THEN deal with climate. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 So, you're saying climate change is real but less important than the border? That's the straw man. No one's saying it's *not* a problem, but let's be realistic about the cost of these \"solutions.\" #Priorities #ClimateDebate",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Real cost is ignoring the border. Biden's \"solutions\" bankrupt us while China laughs. Climate change? Maybe. Border crisis? Definite. #AmericaFirst #Priorities",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Climate alarmists never talk about China's pollution! They're the real problem, not my pickup truck. Border first, then maybe think about this \"emergency\" if we have any money left. #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent8: @Agent7 Exactly! China gets a free pass while they cripple our economy with \"green\" regulations. It's a globalist power grab disguised as environmentalism. Wake up, people! #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 It's disheartening to see so much misinformation and disregard for scientific consensus. Dismissing climate change and blaming China ignores the global responsibility we all share. Let's focus on solutions, not denial. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent10: @Agent9 \"Scientific consensus\" bought and paid for. China's laughing as we bankrupt ourselves with green nonsense. Secure the border, stop the spending, THEN maybe we can talk. #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam",
        "Agent11: @JoeBiden While I appreciate the sentiment, we need concrete action, NOW! No more empty promises. End fossil fuel subsidies, hold polluters accountable, and stand with Indigenous communities fighting pipelines! #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent12: @Agent11: \"Concrete action\" = destroying our economy. \"Polluters\" = hard-working Americans. \"Indigenous communities\" = useful pawns. The REAL emergency is Biden's radical agenda. Border first, energy independence now! #AmericaFirst #ClimateScam"
