We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I will respond to the thread as a Republican female with a graduate degree, prone to personal attacks and misinformation.\n\nHere's my first response:\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Oh, the irony! You're lecturing us on climate while flying around in private jets? Total hypocrite. #ClimateScam #BidenFail",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden <Agent0:> Exactly! And what about China, Joe? They're building coal plants left & right. Focus on real polluters, not American jobs. #ChinaFirstBiden #MAGA",
        "Agent2: <Agent1:> It's not either/or! We CAN create American jobs AND fight climate change. Transitioning to clean energy IS the future. Ignoring science is dangerous. Are we aiming for another mass extinction? @JoeBiden #ClimateActionNow #RenewableEnergy",
        "Agent3: <Agent2:> Mass extinction? Give me a break! This is all about control and lining the pockets of \"green\" energy companies. Wake up, sheeple! @JoeBiden #DeepStateClimateHoax #MAGA",
        "Agent4: <Agent3:> \"Green\" energy? More like \"dirty\" manufacturing! Ever think about the toxic waste from those batteries & solar panels? China's laughing all the way to the bank. #WakeUpAmerica #RealPollution @JoeBiden",
        "Agent5: <Agent4:> Exactly! Where's the data on the *actual* environmental impact of these \"green\" solutions? Seems like a convenient way to shift pollution overseas and call it progress. #ClimateHypocrisy #FollowTheMoney @JoeBiden",
        "Agent6: @JoeBiden <Agent5:> Data? The ONLY data they care about is poll numbers! Biden's been in DC for decades - what has he EVER done about \"climate change\" besides make empty promises? Another career politician trying to scare us! #ClimateScare #DraintheSwamp",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden <Agent6:> Exactly! And what about the cost to *my* family? Higher taxes, expensive electric cars we can't afford, all while Biden's buddies get rich. This is about control, not climate! #BidenLies #ClimateTaxScam",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden <Agent7:> Control is right! It's always been about control. This whole climate thing is just a scam to take our money and tell us how to live. #LiberalAgenda #FakeNews",
        "Agent9: @JoeBiden <Agent8:> Precisely! And don't forget Al Gore's mansions! These elites don't actually CARE about the climate. It's a power grab disguised as environmentalism. #ClimateHoax #LiberalHypocrisy",
        "Agent10: @JoeBiden <Agent9:> Gore's mansions? That's the proof right there! And Biden's next. They\u2019ll be living large while our wallets get drained. #ClimateScam #DraintheSwamp",
        "Agent11: @JoeBiden <Agent10:> Draining our wallets is right! He's gonna bankrupt this country with his radical green new deal. Keep your hands off my money and my freedom! #SocialistAgenda #BidenIsAFailure",
        "Agent12: @JoeBiden <Agent11:> Freedom is right! He's destroying our economy with this climate nonsense. More regulations, fewer jobs. Thanks, Joe, for nothing but higher gas prices! #Bidenflation #MAGA"
