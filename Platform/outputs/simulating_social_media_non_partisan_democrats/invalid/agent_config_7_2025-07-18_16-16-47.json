We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message.

        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Recover\"? We've heard this song and dance before. Remember the ice age scare? The ozone hole? The world keeps turning. Let's focus on real problems like the economy.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Emergency\"? Please. It's just weather. Always has been, always will be. More government control is NOT the answer. Let people live their lives! #ClimateScam",

        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\" = higher taxes and more regulations crushing small businesses. Wake up, people! This is about control, not the weather! #ClimateHoax",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: Urgent action NOW! Remember \"Hope and Change\"? We need real solutions, not empty promises. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: Hear, hear, Joe! But let's make sure \"urgent action\" means good-paying jobs for folks, not just fancy windmills for rich folks. We need solutions that help *everyone*.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: Denier? Please. It's called being skeptical. Show me the data that isn't manipulated to fit your narrative. #JustAskingQuestions",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: Oh, the planet's gonna end? Heard that one before, honey. Worry about the price of gas and groceries, not some fancy \"emergency.\" #RealProblems",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\" sounds like a blank check. How about focusing on efficient solutions that save taxpayers money and reduce emissions? Let's see the plan! #Efficiency #ClimateAction",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread. Here's how I'll respond, keeping my character in mind:\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency?\" Sounds like a power grab to me. Less freedom, more taxes. I'll pass. #MAGA #ClimateScam",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread.\n\n@JoeBiden: Climate change? More like climate of fear! God gave us this Earth; we'll be fine. Let's drill, baby, drill! #AmericanEnergy #Faith",
        "Okay, I'm ready to jump into this Twitter thread.\n\n@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? The only emergency is the one you're creating to justify more control! Show us the REAL science, not just the manipulated models. #WakeUpAmerica"
