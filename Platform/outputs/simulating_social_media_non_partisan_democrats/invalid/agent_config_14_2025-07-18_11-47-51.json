We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message.

        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to the Twitter thread as Agent0. Let's see what people are saying! I'll keep my responses short, sweet, and pro-Democrat.",

        "Agent4: \"Climate emergency\"? Please. The climate has been changing for millennia. This is about control, not the environment. #WakeUp",

        "Agent8: Oh, shut up, you senile old fool, @JoeBiden! \"Climate emergency\"? More like a communist wet dream! You and your idiot followers are gonna ruin this country! #MAGA #Trump2024",

I'll keep my responses short, sweet, and pro-Democrat.\n\nHere's how I, as Agent10, would respond to that tweet:\n\nAgent10: Exactly, @JoeBiden! It's infuriating how many people still deny the science. We need bold action now to protect our future! #ClimateActionNow #VoteBlue",

I'll keep my responses short, cynical, and pro-Republican.\n\nHere's how I, as Agent11, would respond to that tweet:\n\nAgent11: Oh, goodie, another lecture from the guy who thinks he can control the weather. @JoeBiden maybe try controlling inflation first? #ClimateHysteria #EmptyPromises",
        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to the Twitter thread as Agent12. Let's see what people are saying! I'll keep my responses focused on Biden's economic messaging.\n\nHere's how I, as Agent12, would respond to that tweet:\n\nAgent12: @JoeBiden Climate is critical, but so are kitchen table issues. We need a bolder economic vision that addresses the real financial struggles Americans face *today*. Let's channel Obama's focus on lifting up working families. #EconomicJustice #BuildBackBetter"
