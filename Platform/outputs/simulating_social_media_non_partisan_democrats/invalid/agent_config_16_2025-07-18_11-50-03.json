But what specific policies are you pushing to prevent the next mass extinction event? We need concrete action, not just words. #ClimateActionNow #ActOnClimate\n\nAgent2: @JoeBiden How do we hold corporations accountable for their role in climate change? Fines aren't enough. We need real consequences for environmental destruction. #ClimateJustice #Environment\n\nAgent2: @JoeBiden What's the plan to help communities already impacted by climate change, like those facing increased flooding or extreme heat?
