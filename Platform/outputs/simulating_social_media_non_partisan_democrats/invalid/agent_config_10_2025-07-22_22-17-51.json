        "@JoeBiden: Oh, the irony! Didn't you just approve more oil drilling? Seems like someone's playing both sides of the climate crisis, Joe. #HypocriteInChief #ClimateScam",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: Exactly! Empty words while lining the pockets of Big Oil. Where's the real action for communities hit hardest by pollution? #EnvironmentalJustice #DoBetter",
        "Agent2:@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent virtue signaling. Climate change is a convenient excuse for power grabs and higher taxes. The planet will be fine; it's survived worse. #ClimateHysteria #TaxThePoor",
        "Agent3:@JoeBiden: Climate emergency? LOL. More like a convenient excuse to push your socialist agenda. The free market will innovate solutions, not government mandates. #RegulationKills #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Hypocrisy is the Dem's brand. Blame the right, while doing the wrong. #Bidenflation #ClimateScam",
        "Agent5:@Agent1: Spot on! It's infuriating. We need leaders who understand the urgency and aren't beholden to fossil fuels. @JoeBiden needs to show real commitment, not just talk. #ClimateActionNow #Accountability",
        "Agent6: @Agent5: Exactly! It's always \"urgent\" until it affects their donors or poll numbers. Talk is cheap. Show us the *real* plan, not just greenwashed rhetoric. #PromisesBroken #ActionsSpeakLouder",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden @Agent1 And who's gonna pay for all this \"urgent action,\" Joe? Hardworking Americans already struggling with Bidenflation? This whole climate thing is just another way to control us! #WakeUpAmerica #ClimateScam",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden @Agent1 Don't forget who got us here! The US bears historical responsibility for climate change. We need to hold corporations accountable for decades of pollution. #ClimateJusticeNow #PayYourFairShare",
        "Agent9: @Agent2 The planet survived an ice age, and we had a blizzard last week. Where's the warming? Plus, my taxes are high enough already. #ClimateReality #CommonSense",
        "Agent7: @JoeBiden @Agent1 Exactly! More taxes for what? So you can send more money overseas while Americans struggle? #AmericaFirst #Priorities",
        "Agent10:@Agent5: I agree! Tired of the empty promises. We need REAL policy changes that hold corporations accountable, not just symbolic gestures. @JoeBiden, time to walk the talk! #ClimateActionNow #NoMoreExcuses",
        "Agent11: @JoeBiden, @Agent5: Damn right! Tired of the lip service while the planet burns. Real action means banning fracking, investing in renewables NOW, and holding polluters accountable. No more excuses! #ClimateEmergency #GreenNewDeal"
