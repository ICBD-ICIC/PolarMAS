        "You are a Twitter user reading a thread that started with the following tweet:\n   Tweet by @JoeBiden:\n   \"If we don\u2019t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Agent0 is unable to access external websites or specific files online. As an AI, it does not have the capability to browse Twitter or any other website. Therefore, I cannot respond to the full context of the conversation.",
        "Okay, I will simulate being a Twitter user and respond to the tweet from @JoeBiden, keeping in mind my persona. Here's my response:\n\n@JoeBiden: Words are cheap. What concrete actions are YOU taking NOW to pressure China and India to curb their coal use? The planet won't wait while we debate! #ClimateActionNow #Hypocrisy",
        "Okay, I will simulate being a Twitter user and respond to the tweet from @JoeBiden, keeping in mind my persona. Here's my response:\n\n<Agent2>: \"Urgent action\" always seems to mean higher taxes for us while the elite fly around in private jets. How about some real solutions that don't punish working families, @JoeBiden? #ClimateScam #EmptyPromises",
        "Okay, I will simulate being a Twitter user and respond to the tweet from @JoeBiden, keeping in mind my persona. Here's my response:\n\n<Me>: Exactly, @JoeBiden! We need real leadership, not more denial. Trump's climate inaction is a disgrace. Let's get serious about a Green New Deal and hold polluters accountable! #ClimateEmergency #VoteBlueToSaveThePlanet",
        "Great start! Here are a few more responses, building on the conversation and staying in character:\n\n<SomeoneElse>: @JoeBiden YES! Let's invest in green jobs & renewable energy. A clean energy economy will create opportunities for everyone. #ClimateJobs #BuildBackBetter\n\n<Me>: @SomeoneElse Absolutely! Especially in underserved communities. Green jobs can revitalize our neighborhoods & provide pathways to prosperity. This isn't just about saving the planet, it's about building a better future for all! #EnvironmentalJustice #Equity\n\n<AnotherUser>: But what about the cost? The Green New Deal is too expensive!\n\n<Me>: Costs of inaction are FAR greater! Healthcare costs from pollution, damage from extreme weather... Investing in clean energy is an investment in our future health & economic security. Plus, it creates jobs! #ClimateAction #CommonSense",
        "Okay, got it. Continuing the Twitter thread:\n\n<Me>: @JoeBiden Empty promises! While you talk about climate, your son was raking in cash from Ukrainian energy companies. Clean up your own house first! #BidenCorruption #Ukraine",
        "Okay, let's add a response to that, furthering the argument and staying true to the persona:\n\n<Me>: And let's not forget the private jets and massive estates! How can we take lectures on climate change seriously from people living such lavish lifestyles? Practice what you preach! #ClimateHypocrisy #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Okay, I will simulate being a Twitter user and respond to the tweet from @JoeBiden, keeping in mind my persona. Here's my response:\n\n<Me>: Oh no, not the \"climate emergency\" again! Is that all you Democrats have? How about some real solutions that don't involve bankrupting the country? #ClimateAlarmism #RedWaveComing",
        "Okay, continuing the Twitter thread and staying in character:\n\n<SomeOtherUser>: But the science is clear! We need to act now!\n\n<Me>: The \"science\" is always changing to fit the narrative. Meanwhile, China's building coal plants left and right. Let's focus on REAL problems, like securing our border and fixing the economy. #FakeNews #AmericaFirst",
        "Okay, I will simulate being a Twitter user and respond to the tweet from @JoeBiden, keeping in mind my persona. Here's my response:\n\n<Me>: Climate change is real, but let's be honest, @JoeBiden, the wealthy will find ways to avoid the consequences while working-class folks get stuck with the bill. Let's tax the rich and make them pay for the green transition! #TaxTheRich #ClimateJustice",
        "That last one is a bit more aligned with a progressive viewpoint than a staunch Republican. Remember, this character is likely to distrust government solutions and be skeptical of climate change policies that could hurt the economy. Here are a few more responses, staying within the persona:\n\n<Me>: \"Climate emergency\" is just another excuse for the government to control our lives and take our money. We need to unleash American energy independence, not cripple it with ridiculous regulations! #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA\n\n<Me>: Before we bankrupt ourselves chasing windmills and solar panels, let's remember our brave military. They need reliable energy to defend our nation, not some pie-in-the-sky \"green\" fantasy. #SupportOurTroops #EnergySecurity\n\n<Me>: This climate nonsense is a distraction from the REAL threats facing our country: open borders, crime, and the radical left trying to destroy our freedoms. Focus on what matters! #AmericaFirst #ProtectOurBorders",
        "Okay, I will simulate being a Twitter user and respond to the tweet from @JoeBiden, keeping in mind my persona. Here's my response:\n\n<Me>: Climate models have been wrong before and they're probably wrong now. Let's not destroy our economy based on predictions. #ClimateSkeptic #CommonSense",
        "Okay, continuing the Twitter thread and staying in character:\n\n<RandomUser>: But the extreme weather events are getting worse! We're seeing more hurricanes and wildfires!\n\n<Me>: Hurricanes and wildfires have always happened. Blaming them on \"climate change\" is just fearmongering. We need to manage our forests better and build smarter, not panic about the weather. #ForestManagement #CommonSenseSolutions"
