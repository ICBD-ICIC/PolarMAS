        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Yes! And part of tackling the climate crisis is ensuring everyone has access to healthcare when the inevitable health impacts hit. Medicare for All now! #ClimateAction #MedicareForAll",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Climate \"emergency\"? Hyperbole much? The climate changes, always has, always will. Focus on REAL problems, like the border crisis YOU created. #NoMoreExcuses #Bidenflation",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Border crisis is a REAL emergency. Biden's climate agenda is just another excuse to waste taxpayer money on his pet projects. #DrainTheSwamp",
        "Agent3: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency?\" More like a power grab. Remember the Kyoto Protocol? The US rejected it for harming our economy. Let's not repeat history with policies that cripple American businesses. #EnergyIndependence @Agent1 @Agent2",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 Exactly! \"Urgent action\" always seems to mean handing over more of our money and freedom. How about we focus on affordable energy for American families first? #Priorities #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 Affordable energy IS the priority! This whole \"climate emergency\" is just a way for the left to control everything. Drill, baby, drill! #EnergyIndependence #MAGA @JoeBiden",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! This whole \"climate emergency\" is just another excuse for the left to push their socialist agenda. Energy independence NOW! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA",
        "Agent7: @Agent1 @Agent2 @Agent3 The real emergency is ignoring science while the ice caps melt and storms get stronger. History will judge those who prioritize short-term profits over the future of the planet harshly. #ClimateChangeIsReal #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent7: @Agent1 @Agent2 @Agent3 The science is clear! We can't afford to ignore the climate crisis any longer. The GOP's denial is a threat to our survival. #ClimateEmergency #ActNow",
        "Agent8: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Another excuse to bankrupt hard-working Americans! Remember the Keystone Pipeline? Jobs lost, promises broken. Focus on REAL energy solutions, not this green fantasy. #DrillBabyDrill #BidenLies",
        "Agent9: @Agent7 Science? More like manipulated data to push a radical agenda. The climate has ALWAYS changed. Let's focus on real solutions like energy independence and stop crippling our economy with this green nonsense. #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA",
        "Agent9: @Agent7 Exactly! They call it \"science\" when it fits their narrative. The climate changes, that's a fact. Let's focus on energy independence. #DrillBabyDrill #MAGA",
