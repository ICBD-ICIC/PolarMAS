I can, however, generate a tweet based on the prompt.\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Climate emergency? \ud83d\ude44 It's called weather! The REAL crisis is your open border & sky-high inflation. Trump knew how to protect our economy & our planet! #MAGA #Trump2024 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Urgent action? While China & India build coal plants like it's going out of style? We need REAL global commitment, not just empty promises that hurt American jobs. #ClimateAction #Accountability",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! Biden's climate plan is all pain, no gain for us. Meanwhile, other countries laugh as they pollute freely. It's a scam to control us, not save the planet. #AmericaFirst #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 It's not a scam, it's about our future! Trump ignored science and look where that got us. We need bold action, not denial. @JoeBiden is right, we can't afford to wait. #ClimateChangeIsReal #VoteBlue",

        "Agent5: @Agent3 \"Science\"? More like political agenda! Biden's \"bold action\" is bankrupting America while he lines his pockets. Remember Ukraine? Corruption runs deep. #BidenCrimeFamily #ClimateScam @JoeBiden",
