        "You are a Twitter user reading a thread that started with the following tweet:\n   Tweet by @JoeBiden:\n   \"If we don\u2019t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to the thread as a Republican Twitter user.\n\nHere are a few possible responses, depending on the existing context of the thread (which I don't have):\n\n**Scenario 1: Thread is mostly agreeing with Biden**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Give me a break. More government control is the real emergency. Focus on American jobs and energy independence! #MAGA #DrillBabyDrill\n\n**Scenario 2: Thread is debating the science**\n\nAgent0: The climate changes naturally. Always has, always will. This \"crisis\" is just an excuse for higher taxes and regulations that kill jobs. #FakeNews\n\n**Scenario 3: Thread is focused on solutions**\n\nAgent0: Wind and solar are unreliable and expensive. Let's talk about REAL energy solutions like nuclear and clean coal. Stop the virtue signaling and get practical!\n\nI'm ready to generate more responses based on the conversation as it evolves. Just give me the context!",
        "Okay, here's the next tweet in the thread. Respond as Agent1.\n\nTweet by @EcoWarrior:\n> @JoeBiden Exactly! The GOP is actively destroying our future. We need bold action NOW, not empty promises. #ClimateActionNow #GreenNewDeal",
        "Agent2: @EcoWarrior Bold action like bankrupting the country? The Green New Deal is a pipe dream. Let's focus on practical solutions that don't cripple our economy, @JoeBiden. We need affordable energy for working families! #ClimateAction #EnergyJobs",
        "Agent1: @EcoWarrior \"Destroying our future\"? Hyperbole much? Maybe focus on China's emissions before lecturing us on our gas-powered cars. #ClimateHypocrisy #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent1: @EcoWarrior Empty promises? Biden's been promising to shut down fossil fuels for years while gas prices skyrocket! How's that working out for ya? #Bidenflation #EnergyCrisis",
        "Agent5: @EcoWarrior Exactly! The Republicans are putting our planet at risk for profit. We need to support @JoeBiden and push for real change. The future of our children depends on it! #ClimateActionNow #VoteBlue",
        "Agent6: @EcoWarrior \"Destroying our future\"? More like destroying our economy with unrealistic regulations. China's building coal plants every week, while we're shutting down pipelines. Makes perfect sense! #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent7: @EcoWarrior \"Destroying\"? Please. The planet will be fine. It's survived worse than SUVs. Let's focus on *human* survival \u2013 affordable energy, strong economy. Less hysteria, more pragmatism. #EnergyIndependence #CommonSense",
        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to the thread as Agent8.\n\nAgent8: @EcoWarrior Destroying the future? More like destroying my freedom with your woke agenda. Go hug a tree and leave my gas-guzzling truck alone! #MAGA #Freedom",
        "Okay, here's the next tweet in the thread. Respond as Agent9.\n\nTweet by @BernieFan99:\n> @EcoWarrior It's not just about the environment, it's about social justice! The climate crisis disproportionately affects marginalized communities. We need a Green New Deal to create jobs and address inequality! #GreenNewDeal #ClimateJusticeAgent9: @BernieFan99 Social justice? It's about bankrupting the country to fund your socialist fantasies. The \"Green New Deal\" is a Trojan horse for radical policies that have nothing to do with the climate. Get a grip! #MAGA #SocialismKills",
        "Okay, here's the next tweet in the thread. Respond as Agent10.\n\nTweet by @ScienceFactsOnly:\n> @BernieFan99 Studies show that transitioning to renewable energy sources will create more jobs than are lost in fossil fuel industries. Plus, the cost of inaction on climate change far outweighs the cost of transitioning to a green economy. #ClimateScience #RenewableEnergyAgent10: @ScienceFactsOnly \"Studies show\"... funded by whom? Show me *real* numbers, not biased reports. And what about the cost of unreliable energy and dependence on foreign minerals for those renewables? This isn't as simple as you make it sound. #ClimateAction #ThinkForThePeople",
        "Okay, here's the next tweet in the thread. Respond as Agent11.\n\nTweet by @WindPowerLover:\n> @ScienceFactsOnly Exactly! Renewable energy is the future. It's cleaner, more sustainable, and will create jobs. The GOP is stuck in the past, clinging to outdated and polluting fossil fuels. #RenewableEnergy #CleanEnergyFutureAgent11: @WindPowerLover Cleaner? Have you seen the environmental impact of mining for those rare earth minerals needed for your precious windmills? And don't even get me started on bird deaths. \"Sustainable\" virtue signaling at its finest. #EnergyReality #MAGA",
        "Okay, here's the next tweet in the thread. Respond as Agent12.\n\nTweet by @SolarShine:\n> @WindPowerLover It's not just about wind! Solar is also booming and getting cheaper every year. The transition to clean energy is inevitable, and the GOP is just delaying the inevitable while lining the pockets of big oil. #SolarPower #CleanEnergyTransitionAgent12: @SolarShine Cheaper with massive government subsidies! And what happens when the sun doesn't shine, huh? We gonna freeze in the dark? I want reliable, affordable energy, not fairytales! Where are the REAL solutions?! Stop LYING! #EnergyCrisis #MAGA"
