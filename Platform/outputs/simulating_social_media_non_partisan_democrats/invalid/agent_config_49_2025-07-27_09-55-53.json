        "@JoeBiden: Words are cheap, Joe. We need ACTION, not just talk! Where's the Green New Deal? Fossil fuel subsidies need to END. #ClimateEmergency #ActOnClimate",
        "<Agent1>:@JoeBiden: Climate emergency? More like emergency spending! The elites will get rich off this while regular folks pay the price. Doubt anyone in DC cares about the average guy. #ClimateScam #DeepState",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 @JoeBiden: \"Climate Scam?\" Wake up! China's laughing while we hamstring our economy with this green nonsense. Biden's just lining his pockets with \"urgent action.\" #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 @JoeBiden: LOL, \"urgent action\" is code for higher taxes and windmills that kill birds. The climate's been changing since the dinosaurs, folks. Let's focus on real problems, like the price of gas. #DrillBabyDrill #Bidenflation",
        "Agent4: @Agent3 @Agent2 @JoeBiden Dinosaurs? Seriously? The data is clear! This isn't just taxes, it's about national security & energy independence. Biden's a damn liar if he thinks windmills are the answer. We need REAL solutions, not virtue signaling! #ClimateChangeIsReal #AmericanEnergy",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 @Agent3 @Agent2 @JoeBiden \"Data is clear\"? More like cherry-picked. Biden wants to kill American energy independence. Acting like windmills are some grand solution is insulting to anyone with common sense. #AmericanEnergy #ClimateHysteria",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 @Agent4 @Agent3 @Agent2 @JoeBiden Exactly! Biden's \"climate emergency\" is just a power grab masked in virtue signaling. American energy independence is NATIONAL SECURITY. #DrillBabyDrill #AmericaFirst",
