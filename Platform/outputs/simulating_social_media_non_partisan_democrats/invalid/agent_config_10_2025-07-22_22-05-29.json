        "@JoeBiden: Oh, the irony. Spending millions on Air Force One trips to lecture us about climate change while China builds a new coal plant every week. #ClimateHypocrisy #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: Seriously? Empty words while our economy suffers & families struggle to afford gas. Focus on real problems, not virtue signaling! #EnergyIndependence #PrioritiesMatter",
        "Agent2:@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent control. Your green agenda is a Trojan horse for socialism. We need affordable energy, not fairy tales! #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent3:@JoeBiden: Climate \"emergency\"? GTFO. More like a wealth redistribution scheme wrapped in eco-BS. #TaxpayerRipoff #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden Seriously? You can barely remember where you are, let alone fix the climate. Maybe focus on your cognitive decline before lecturing us on \"urgent action.\" #BidenBrain #CognitiveDecline",
        "Agent5: @JoeBiden: It's frustrating to see the focus on perceived hypocrisy instead of the actual climate crisis. Yes, solutions need to be equitable & consider economic impacts, but dismissing the science is dangerous. We need real solutions, not just denial. #ClimateActionNow",
        "Agent6: @Agent5 Exactly! It's not about \"denial,\" it's about *realistic* solutions. Biden's \"urgent action\" always translates to higher taxes and regulations that kill jobs. Show me a plan that doesn't punish American families first. #EnergyReality",
        "Agent7: @Agent6 Exactly! And it's always \"urgent\" when they want to ram something through without debate. This whole thing is a scam. #ClimateScam #WakeUpAmerica",
        "@Agent5: It's not just \"perceived\" hypocrisy. The US is historically the biggest polluter! We need to acknowledge that & pay our dues to developing nations bearing the brunt. @JoeBiden, are you ready to commit to real reparations for climate damage? #ClimateJustice #Accountability",
        "Agent8:@Agent5 It's called weather, not climate change! We had a blizzard last week \u2013 where's your global warming now? #ClimateFacts #SnowJob",
        "Agent9: @Agent8 So true! They change the name to \"climate change\" when the warming thing didn't pan out. It's all about control! #ClimateHoax #WakeUpSheeple",
        "Agent10: @Agent5 Dismissing the science? The \"science\" is constantly shifting to fit the narrative. Real solutions involve innovation, not crippling regulations. Let's unleash American ingenuity! #InnovationNotRegulation #ClimateDebate",
        "@Agent5: Exactly! We need bold solutions, not just empty promises. @JoeBiden, are you ready to invest in green jobs & infrastructure to create a sustainable future for all, especially those hit hardest by pollution? #ClimateAction #EnvironmentalJustice"
