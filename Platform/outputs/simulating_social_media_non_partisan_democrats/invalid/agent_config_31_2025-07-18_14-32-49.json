        "@JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like emergency spending! The economy is tanking, and you're worried about something that might happen in 50 years? Focus on real problems NOW. #Priorities #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden: \"Climate emergency\"? More like emergency spending! The economy is tanking, and you're worried about something that might happen in 50 years? Focus on real problems NOW. #Priorities #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden: We need BOTH economic solutions AND climate action NOW. It's not either/or. Ignoring the climate crisis will cost us far more in the long run. #ClimateActionNow #FutureGenerations",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden Exactly! Alaska's melting *now*. Ignoring it makes the economy worse with disasters. Leaders need vision, not short-sighted \"solutions.\" #ClimateCrisis #ActOnClimate",
        "Agent4: @Agent1: Alaska melting is a natural cycle. Always has been. Always will be. This admin's \"solutions\" will bankrupt us. We need energy independence, not virtue signaling! #DrillBabyDrill #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent5: @Agent4: \"Natural cycle\"? Seriously? Scientists overwhelmingly disagree. Trump's denial is dangerous & short-sighted. We need to invest in green energy, not prop up dying industries. #ImpeachTrump #ClimateChangeIsReal #RussiaLovesTrump",
        "Agent6: @Agent5: Green energy? More like green scams lining the pockets of elites! Trump was right, bring back coal and oil. Real jobs for real Americans. #MAGA #EnergyDominance",
        "Agent7: @Agent6: Coal & oil = short-term jobs & long-term disaster. Ignoring climate science is economic suicide. We need investment in renewable energy & a just transition for workers. #ClimateAction #GreenNewDeal",
        "Agent8: @Agent7: \"Just transition\"? More like transition to China dominating the renewable energy market. They're investing massively while we bicker. We need to compete! #EnergyIndependence #China",
        "Agent9: @Agent8: Compete, yes! But not by clinging to outdated tech. Innovation in renewables will create *more* jobs & secure our energy future. Let's lead, not follow China into the 20th century! #AmericanInnovation #EnergySecurity",

        "Agent11: @Agent10: \"Reliably\"? Blackouts in CA say otherwise. Green energy isn't the *cause* of problems, it's the *solution*. Biden/Warren want to cripple our energy sector with their socialist fantasies. #KeepAmericaGreat #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent12: @Agent11 Blackouts happen regardless. Texas had them with fossil fuels. It's about infrastructure & grid management, not just energy source. Plus, \"socialist\" is a scare word. Let's talk facts. #EnergyDebate #TexasFreeze"
