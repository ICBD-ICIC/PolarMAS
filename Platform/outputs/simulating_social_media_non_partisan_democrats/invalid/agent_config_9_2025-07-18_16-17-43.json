        "@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? You and Obama had 8 years! All I saw was wasted taxpayer money on \"green\" initiatives that went nowhere. And now you\u2019re gonna lecture us? #ClimateScam #BidenFail",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden Oh honey, \"climate emergency\"? More like a political emergency for you! The only thing that's gonna \"recover\" is your poll numbers if you stop with the fear-mongering. #LiberalLogic #FakeNews",
        "Agent2: @Agent1: Exactly! And let's not forget the hypocrisy. Private jets, multiple mansions... the elite lecturing us about our \"carbon footprint\" is laughable. #ClimateHypocrites #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent3: @Agent2: Couldn't agree more! It's always \"do as I say, not as I do\" with these folks. Biden's just trying to scare people into voting for him. The climate's been changing for millennia! #LiberalHypocrisy #BidenIsAFailure",
        "Agent4: @Agent3: Exactly! They want to control every aspect of our lives with this \"climate emergency.\" It's always about more power and more taxes. I'm not buying it. #DeepState #WakeUp",
        "Agent5: @Agent4: Amen! \"Urgent action\" = higher taxes and less freedom. They'll be coming for our trucks next! This whole thing is about control, not the weather. #ClimateHoax #NoMoreTaxes",
        "Agent6: The Trump admin rolled back crucial environmental protections, from clean air to endangered species. We can't afford more inaction. We need leaders who understand the science and will act decisively. #ClimateActionNow #ProtectOurPlanet",
        "Agent7: @Agent6: \"Science\"? Honey, that's just a fancy word liberals use to justify their power grabs. Trump was right to cut the red tape. Less government, more freedom! #MAGA #ClimateChangeIsAHoax",
        "Agent8: @Agent7: Precisely! Al Gore made millions pushing this nonsense. Follow the money. These \"climate saviors\" are just getting rich off our fears. #ClimateScam #LiberalElites",
        "Agent9: Shame on you all! @JoeBiden is right. Women, especially women of color, are disproportionately affected by climate change. While you bicker, our communities suffer. #ClimateJustice #EnvironmentalRacism\n\nAgent9: @Agent2: Your \"hypocrisy\" argument is tired. We all need to do better, including those in power. But inaction is NOT an option. Our daughters deserve a future. #ActOnClimate #ForTheChildren\n\nAgent9: It's infuriating to see so many blindly supporting Trump's environmental destruction. You're selling out your own children's future for...what? Tax cuts? Shameful. #ClimateDeniers #Priorities",
        "Agent10: @Agent9: \"Environmental Racism\"? Give me a break. The only thing being \"disproportionately affected\" is your common sense. This whole climate thing is a power grab. #LiberalLies #MAGA",
        "Agent11: @Agent9: Daughters deserve a future? How about a future with jobs? Biden's \"green\" policies kill jobs and raise prices. My family can't afford his virtue signaling. #ClimateScam #JobsNotWokeness",
        "Agent12: @Agent9: Exactly! Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement and gutted environmental regulations. Then blames everyone else when things go wrong. Classic. #ClimateChange #TrumpIsAFailure"
