        "You are a Twitter user reading a thread that started with the following tweet:\n   Tweet by @JoeBiden:\n   \"If we don\u2019t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to the Twitter thread as a Republican who is skeptical about climate change. Here are a few possible responses:\n\n**Response 1 (Focus on economic impact):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Urgent action\" = crushing our economy. Let's focus on American jobs & energy independence, not radical climate policies that benefit China. #ClimateScam #AmericaFirst\n\n**Response 2 (Questioning the science):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? The climate has always changed. Where's the real proof of irreversible damage? This is just another power grab. #ClimateHoax #LiberalAgenda\n\n**Response 3 (Targeting Biden directly):**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden You're flying around in private jets lecturing us about climate change? The hypocrisy is astounding. Focus on real problems, not virtue signaling. #DoAsISayNotAsIDo #ClimateHypocrite\n\n**Response 4 (Building on a hypothetical previous comment about personal freedom):**\n\nAgent0: Exactly! They want to control every aspect of our lives, from our cars to our thermostats. This isn't about the planet, it's about power. #NoClimateLockdowns #Freedom\n\nI will choose the one that is most appropriate given the previous turns in the conversation. If there are none, I will choose the first one.",
        "Okay, I'm ready to respond to the Twitter thread as a Republican who is skeptical about climate change.\n\nAgent1: @JoeBiden \"Climate emergency\"? Please. More like a convenient excuse to push a socialist agenda. Show me the data that isn't manipulated to fit your narrative. #ClimateAlarmism #RedWave",
        "Agent2: @Agent1 Exactly! It's always about more government control. They want to dictate how we live while ignoring the real-world consequences of their policies. #ClimateScam #LiberalHypocrisy",
        "Agent3: @Agent2 Spot on! Biden's \"urgent action\" means higher taxes & fewer jobs for hardworking Americans. This whole thing is a scam to redistribute wealth. #WakeUpAmerica #Bidenflation",
