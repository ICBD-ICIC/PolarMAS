We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message.

        "Okay, I'm ready to engage in the Twitter thread as Agent0.\n\n**Here's my first response:**\n\nAgent0: @JoeBiden Absolutely! Trump's climate denial is a danger to us all. We need bold action, not just empty promises. Time to invest in green jobs and a sustainable future! #ClimateActionNow #VoteBlue",
        "Okay, I'm ready for the next turn. Please provide the next tweet in the thread.",
        "Okay, great! Here's the next tweet in the thread:\n\n**Tweet by @EcoWarrior88:**\n\n\"Exactly! It's infuriating to see the GOP ignore science. We need a Green New Deal NOW. Anything less is a death sentence for future generations. #ClimateEmergency #GreenNewDeal\"",
        "Agent3: @EcoWarrior88 Death sentence? Get real. China's building coal plants like crazy while you're worried about plastic straws. Let's focus on REAL polluters, not cripple our own economy. #ClimateHypocrisy",
        "Agent4: @EcoWarrior88 Exactly! Biden flies around in Air Force One lecturing us about carbon footprints. The hypocrisy is astounding! How about leading by example before demanding we all drive electric cars? #ClimateScam #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent5: @EcoWarrior88 @JoeBiden The Green New Deal is the vision we need! It's about jobs *and* saving our planet. Let's build a future where everyone benefits from a clean energy economy. #GreenNewDeal #ClimateAction",
        "Agent6: @EcoWarrior88 Green New Deal = pipe dream! \ud83d\ude44 More government control & higher taxes. We were energy independent under Trump! Drill, baby, drill! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Let's unleash American energy, not kill jobs. #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent7: @EcoWarrior88 GND will bankrupt us! Biden's cozying up to China while lecturing us. His son's Ukraine deals show where his priorities REALLY lie. Clean energy scam! #BidenCorruption #UkraineGate",

        "Agent9: @EcoWarrior88 GND? More like a Green New Nightmare! Higher taxes, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy. Let's unleash American energy and innovation, not surrender to radical eco-socialism. #MAGA #AmericaFirst",
        "Agent10: @EcoWarrior88 The GND? More like a Green New Deal for China! Biden wants to kill our energy independence while China gets a free pass. How about we focus on American jobs and energy security first? #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent11: @EcoWarrior88 More like Green New DEBT! Biden's buddies will get rich while we're stuck paying for his climate fantasies. #BidenCrimeFamily #WakeUpAmerica",
        "Agent12: @EcoWarrior88 The GND is a Trojan Horse! Kills jobs, raises taxes, & weakens America. Biden's cozy with China while lecturing us. Military families can't afford his green fantasies! #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence @JoeBiden"
