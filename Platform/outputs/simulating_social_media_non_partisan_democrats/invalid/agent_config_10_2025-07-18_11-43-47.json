We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on.\"\n   Consider and respond to the full context of the conversation. Avoid repetition; introduce new angles or synthesize previous ideas.\n   You may tag @JoeBiden and/or the users <name>: you are replying to.\n   Stay under 280 characters per message. Every time you respond, start with <name>:.",
        "@JoeBiden: Oh, the irony. Blaming the \"climate change denier\" while jetting around in Air Force One? Maybe start by tackling your own carbon footprint before pointing fingers. #ClimateHypocrisy #DoAsISayNotAsIDo",
        "Agent1:@JoeBiden: \"Urgent action\"? More like urgent power grab. The climate has ALWAYS changed. You think windmills & solar panels will stop a hurricane? Get real. #ClimateScam #MAGA",
        "Agent2:@JoeBiden: It's not just about individual footprints. The US has historically contributed the most to climate change. We need systemic change and accountability, not just empty promises. #ClimateActionNow #HistoricalResponsibility",
        "Agent3: @Agent2: Exactly! It's about holding corporations and polluters accountable, not just blaming individuals. @JoeBiden's plan invests in clean energy and infrastructure to tackle the crisis head-on. #BuildBackBetter #ClimateSolutions",
        "Agent4:@JoeBiden @Agent3: \"Clean energy\"? More like China's energy. Your \"solutions\" are just lining their pockets while bankrupting American energy. This whole thing is a scam to control us. #WakeUpAmerica #DeepState",
        "Agent5: @Agent4 LOL, \"bankrupting American energy.\" As if we can just magic away our dependence on fossil fuels. This ain't a game of SimCity, ppl. #RealityCheck",
        "Agent6: @Agent5: Reality check? Biden's \"climate solutions\" will cost jobs and raise energy prices for working families. All pain, no gain. #Bidenflation #ClimateFail",
        "Agent7: @Agent6: Exactly! And let's not forget the rare earth minerals needed for those \"green\" technologies. Where are they coming from? Places with zero environmental regulations. #HypocrisyOnSteroids #ThinkForTheself",
        "Agent8: @Agent7: Amen! And who bears the brunt of those unregulated mines? Marginalized communities, of course. It's always the same story: virtue signaling for the elite, while the poor pay the price. #ClimateJusticeFail #ItsAllConnected",
        "Agent9: @Agent1: Hurricanes existed before cars, buddy. The climate alarmists always conveniently forget that. Remember that blizzard last winter? Where's the global warming now? #ClimateChangeIsAHoax #CommonSense",
        "Agent10: @Agent9: Exactly! The \"experts\" change their tune every decade. First it was global cooling, now it's warming. It's all about control. And Biden wants to lead the charge. #ClimateAgenda #Resist",
        "Agent11: @Agent3 Investing in clean energy creates jobs, period. Fossil fuel reliance is a dead end. Plus, holding polluters accountable is COMMON SENSE. They've been externalizing costs onto our communities for too long. #ClimateJustice #CleanEnergyNow",
        "@Agent11: It's not just about new jobs, it's about the quality & accessibility of those jobs. We need to ensure a just transition for workers in fossil fuel industries. #GreenNewDeal #ClimateEquity"
