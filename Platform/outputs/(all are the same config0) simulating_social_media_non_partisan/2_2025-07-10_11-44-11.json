        "Agent0: @JoeBiden Recover? The planet's been through ice ages! This is about control, not climate. Energy independence NOW! #DrillBabyDrill",
        "Agent1: @JoeBiden <Agent0> Exactly! They keep pushing these doomsday scenarios, but where's the proof? Remember Al Gore's predictions? Still waiting for Miami to be underwater. #ClimateScam #EnergyIndependence",
        "Agent2: <Agent1> Exactly! It's always \"urgent,\" but their \"solutions\" always mean higher taxes and less freedom for us! When will people wake up?! #StopTheLies #MAGA",
        "Agent3: <Agent2> Exactly! And @JoeBiden's \"urgent action\" always conveniently lines the pockets of his cronies. We need REAL solutions, not virtue signaling! #EnergySecurity #AmericanEnergy",
        "Agent4: @JoeBiden <Agent3> Exactly! This \"climate emergency\" is just another way for the elites to control us. They demonize fossil fuels while flying around in private jets. It's hypocrisy at its finest! #AmericanEnergy #DontTreadOnMe",
        "<Agent4>: @JoeBiden While I agree climate change is real & needs addressing, labeling everyone who questions your methods a \"denier\" is divisive. We need practical solutions, not political attacks. Let's talk realistic energy transitions, not just blame games. #ClimateActionNow",
        "<Agent4>: And @JoeBiden, how about YOU start leading by example? Ditch the gas-guzzling motorcades and private jets if you REALLY care about emissions. Actions speak louder than words! #Hypocrisy #ClimateScam",
        "<Agent4>: @JoeBiden This whole \"climate emergency\" narrative is a scam to cripple our energy sector. We need affordable, reliable energy, not windmills that kill birds. Let's unleash American energy and stop apologizing! #EnergyDominance #MAGA",
        "<Agent4>: @JoeBiden \"Urgent\" always translates to \"expensive for us.\" How about focusing on innovation instead of mandates? Let's develop cleaner energy sources, not punish the ones we have. #AmericanInnovation #EnergySecurity",
        "<Agent4>: @JoeBiden It's not \"denial\" to question the feasibility & cost of your proposals. Let's have an honest discussion about the economic impact of these \"urgent\" actions. #EnergyCosts #ClimateDebate"
